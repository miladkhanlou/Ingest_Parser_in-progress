   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A single skeleton sits up, as if a restless,  in its final resting place.</abstract>
   <note type="content">Considered by the artist to be her favorite print. The colors used are greenish dark grey, brownish grey and a greenish black. The initial drawing was made using brush and ink with scraping. The idea for this composition came to the artist while she traveled through the Italian countryside. It was then that she passed an enormous American cemetery for those servicemen  who died during the war (WWII). The cemetery covered several hills as does the cemetery scene depicted in the print. The stars in the print were created by scraping and "picking" out these areas with a fine pointed lithographic needle.</note>

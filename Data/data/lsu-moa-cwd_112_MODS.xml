   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print is composed of shades of green with random veiled areas of yellow. White areas with selected magenta patches are also evident in the composition.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This is a  cliché verre which required two printings to achieve the desired results. The artist related that she felt the yellow areas were needed to balance the color composition, while the magenta filters through to add warmth to the work. &lt;Ms. Durieux had no intention as to the work's social comment, as she was simply experimenting with the different time exposures to the light source.. The artist cut out shapes in paper then allowed the light to work upon exposed areas. This work was quite experimental as there were no real calibrations with concern to the light exposure.</note>

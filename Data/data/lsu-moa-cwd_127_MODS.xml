   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Within an elongated vertical oval, the legs of two figures stand on a light and dark diamond patterned floor. All that can be seen of the male figure is the skeletal form of his legs and feet from a back sided angle. He faces his lover, a female of whom the viewer can see only a little of her very short skirt which looks like a skater's costume. Her spindly legs are thinner than the skeletal ones of her lover's. Her feet are incased in male type house slippers, each decorated with a pompon.</abstract>

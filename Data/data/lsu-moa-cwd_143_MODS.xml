   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This lithograph was printed in 1936. It was the first work in which the artist used a zinc plate rather than the usual lithographic stone. The print was printed by George Miller in New York. Ms. Durieux had never drawn on a zinc plate before and therefore was hesitant in her use of strong blacks. She related that, at the time of the print's planning, she figured scraping wouldn't work as well on the zinc plate as on the lithographic stone; therefore she minimized her use of scraping. The idea for the print becomes quite obvious when one compares how the "nice men" stand out vividly from their white background with the manner in which "American types" stand out when seen in a foreign country. This was the gist of the artist's intention. An added touch of humor is suggested by the handling of the conspicuous pockets and bow ties of the men.</abstract>

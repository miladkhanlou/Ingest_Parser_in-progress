   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The inspiration for this composition came during a trip to Santiago do Chile. While visiting the city, the artist was fascinated with the quick-moving "flocks" of priests who moved along the streets. She felt they resembled flocks of blackbirds darting along in their groups. Ms. Durieux quickly sketched the initial plan for the print upon returning to the hotel room. The artist related that although the intention was to suggest the anonymity created by the priests' clerical garb and gestures, she purposely commented on the individuality of each priest's facial features. Each member of the flock is distinctly suggestive of the Indian and Spanish priests seen in the city. This particular print is from the second printing of the design/composition.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print is from the second lithographic edition ever done by the artist. It was printed in 1932 in Mexico City at the Senefelders.</note>

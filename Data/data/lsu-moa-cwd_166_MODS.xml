   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print depicts the Queen of Mardi Gras while at the parade gallery of the Boston Club. The youthful Queen surrounded by her court, holds a traditional bouquet.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed by the artist and is included among those in her "Mardi Gras Series.. The print done on stone, was drawn using lithographic pencil. Ms.  Durieux saw this particular Queen and considered the young girl not only to be chic but clever. The choice of the smart-looking, wide-brim hat made the young lady obvious and she stood out from the crowd. Ms. Durieux was also intrigued by the repetition of the circular device, as noted in the bouquet and repeated in the hat.</note>

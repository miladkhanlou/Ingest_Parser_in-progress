   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene presents a representation of a carnival ball in which a social presentation of marriageable young ladies are escorted by masked gentlemen of the carnival court.  These are viewed by the elderly mothers and grandmothers, who gossip and comment on the young replicas of themselves, their daughters. The artist presents in this self-contained design, females as the important elements. The males serve as decorative elements within the composition. The satire and the design are built on a circular movement. One may interpret the representation of the three generations as three generations of "puppets" repeating a social pattern. Also, the series of circles within the composition may suggest the idea that the New Orleans' spirit of Carnival is never ending, a tradition that goes on from generation to generation.</abstract>

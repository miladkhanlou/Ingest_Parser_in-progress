   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene depicts a night parade in which the king of this particular carnival organization rides atop his float illuminated by the glare from numerous torches.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print was done in stone, drawn using a lithographic pencil. A great deal of scraping was used throughout the composition. The artist related that the print 's scene may now be considered a period piece, as the torches of this type are no longer in use. The suggestion of light illuminating from the torches and the "dripping sparks" are created by employing large amounts of scraping.</note>

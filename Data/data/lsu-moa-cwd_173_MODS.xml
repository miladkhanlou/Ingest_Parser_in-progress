   <abstract displayLabel="Description">American tourists.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed as a part of the artist's North American Series. The print was made from zinc plates execute in Taxco, Mexico. The actual drawing was made by the artist, depicting a tourist couple she saw while in Mexico. The couple appeared very earnest and very rugged to the artist. She noted that they both appeared with sharp features with piercing eyes. This prints employs an economy of tonal values, allowing line to dominate. Line is most carefully used by the artist. One may note that Line, due to cautious and precise handling by the artist, creates a feeling of air and space within the composition. Such is suggested by definite "breaks" between linear points -- allowing a negative space to exist between line, with no lines overlapping.</note>

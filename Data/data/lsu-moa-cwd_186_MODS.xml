   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The "Creature" were created from the imagination of the artist and are3 abstracted forms which seem to float throughout the composition.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This is a three color lithograph with an overprinting of a whitish-green. The colors used are yellow-grey, blue-green, and red. The drawing was made using lithographic crayon with brush and ink. The crayon allows for the texturing of the central massing of the picture plane. Ms. Durieux stated that this texturing creates a warm feeling to her and the use of warm red throughout the composition suggests to her the warmth of the solar system.</note>

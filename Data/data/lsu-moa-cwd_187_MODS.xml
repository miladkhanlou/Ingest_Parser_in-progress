   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene is a depiction of a group of spectators assembled to witness an event in New Orleans's City Park. The artist recalled that the sickly-looking palm trees in the background immediately brought to mind such that were "growing" in City Park. "Perhaps they were blessed with death during the last great cold spell New Orleans had.. The spectators, who view an activity placed outside the picture plane, are simply American types often used by the artist. "They're no one in particular, "says the artist, until someone says, 'why, that's so-and-so.'"</abstract>

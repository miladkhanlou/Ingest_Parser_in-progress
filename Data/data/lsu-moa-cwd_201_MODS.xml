   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene depicts two figures turning into stone. One can only guess at the cause for this transformation as all details are eliminated to give an abstract symbolic quality to the work.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed by the artist while at LSU. The drawing, done on stone, was made using lithographic pencil. The figures appear to cling together in terror in the presence of an unseen force outside the vignetted picture plane. The force, claims the artist, is terror itself. Ms. Durieux related that she felt the statement of the print is still valid today, as the world doesn't look any better then it did then.</note>

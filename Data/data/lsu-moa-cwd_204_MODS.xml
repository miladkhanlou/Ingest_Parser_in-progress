   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print depicts a study of two elderly faces. Both appear to be female and seem quite alert and active.The colors used were green, blue, and flesh. It was these inks which when rolled up on the drawing of the stone gave the final color print. The drawing itself was made using lithographic pencil and scraping. The artist activates the entire composition by her use of a quick short staccato-type lines which move quickly across the surface. These lines create delicate tonal areas throughout the faces. By using a variation in the actual thickness of contour lines, the artist creates a feeling of spatial environment  for the characters.</abstract>

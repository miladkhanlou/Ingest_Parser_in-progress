   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A woman with veil.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print was drawn with a lithographic pencil and ink on stone. The entire satire lies in the fact that in this work, the "veil" veils nothing. The female is revealed for what she is  and she cannot hide behind the veil. The obvious character of the woman is revealed not only in her facial expression, but also by the military suggestion of her costume. The emphasis on the veil is created by use of ink and pen. The dots were created using ink, while the crisp line was fashioned with pen and ink. The crumbling lines in the print resulted from using a lithographic pencil and crayon.</note>

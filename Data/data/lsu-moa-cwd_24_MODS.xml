   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print depicts emaciated figures, one male one female, who appear quite alone in their afflictions.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This etching was printed in the home studio of the artist. The print was made using white ink on blue oriental paper. An additional edition was printed in  the traditional black on white. Ms. Durieux related that the most popular of the two editions were those done in white on blue. A fine delicate character of line appears throughout the etching and by means of crosshatching and linear overlay, the artist creates a delicacy of tonal values within the forms. Bold white lines serve as boundary  lines between and around each figure.</note>

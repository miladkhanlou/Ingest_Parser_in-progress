   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Two woman singers singing in a bar on Bourbon Street, New Orleans, La. The tile explains the scene, one typical to the nightclub activity of Bourbon Street. The scene is an active one in which a crowded audience of sailors and soldiers enjoy the performance of two female singers.</abstract>
   <note type="content">A minimal amount of scraping was employed by the artist on this print. The print was done in response to an invitation for Ms. Durieux's participation in a traveling exhibition. This 1942  exhibition was entitled "Artists for Victory" and was organized by the New York Graphic Society. The print is an artist copy. Ms Durieux related that another copy of this print "traveled" the entire South Pacific by boat. It seems that print was purchased by the wife of a commander of a P.T. boat and presented to her husband, who carried the print with him throughout his tour of duty. The singers, place in the immediate foreground, appear to convey the lively rhythm of "swing" music, so popular in the 1940's.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The drawing depicts the first commencement seen  by the artist at LSU. The figures also suggested to the artist the "Captains of Erudition" from Thorstein Viblems' the Higher Learning in America. Symbols are employed within the design. For example, the birds are buzzards flying in the background. Buzzards are usually associated as being attracted to dead things and as Ms. Durieux  commented, "...some commencements are dead from the start..." must be careful that every line used must serve a purpose. She the added that same is true of satire, everything used must serve the purpose of the satire.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed by the artist at LSU in 1947. The print uses an economy of line, with all lines made by a lithographic crayon on stone. The width of the line determines the tone of the print.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This bust-length female figure is not an actual portrait, but is another of the satirical "types" drawn from the artist's imagination. The figure is turned left roughly three quarters to the picture plane. The subject is a thin woman with thin, penciled eyebrows, and an upturned nose which terminates in broad nostrils. The subject's eyes are narrow slits and she has high cheekbones, as well as thin lips with very dark lipstick  and her teeth are uneven. Her hair is arranged in a very curly permanent as was fashionable during the 1930s. Her dress has a square cut neckline which is bordered with ruffles and there are puff sleeves at the shoulders made of a mesh material which is decorated with stars.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print is part of the artists' y MRSINorth American Seriesttp://, and was printed from zinc plates and executed in Taxco, Mexico. This print is unnumbered and was not included in Cynthia Lamey's Caroline Durieux exhibition in 1965. Mrs. Durieux cannot remember the print. She thinks that this is a printer's proof of a lithograph that was never made as an edition.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This subject matter, as seen in the large dark hands which loom in the  central picture plane, reflects the artist's reaction to the growing public awareness of the racial problem in society which began to make itself heard during the fifties.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed by the artist at LSU. The print was done using stone on which the drawing was made using a lithographic pencil. Scraping was employed in moderation. The lithograph displays some innovations used by the artist. Ms. Durieux was, at the time of the printing, interested in seeing how far she could carry the black and white lithograph technique. Here, she creates  the hazy areas and fuzz-like edges by rubbing these areas with a piece of felt which results in a smoky haze. The composition is printed on Basinwerk parchment, which is a quality  English paper.</note>

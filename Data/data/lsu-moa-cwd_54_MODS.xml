   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The heavy, sagging body of the woman, who sits on the stoop outside her house, adds to the unsuspected ridicule of the woman. To add to the ridicule she sits attired in her finery, with lace trimming and a flower pinned in her hair. What might have been an alluring position in a young woman becomes sadly vulgar here.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed at LSU. This print, drawn entirely in pencil on stone, uses title to create the irony of the satire. Ms. Durieux related that she often saw such a scene in New Orleans . There were two ladies in particular who'd sit outside, apparently a very old habit of the two. It was from these two that Ms. Durieux was inspired to make this design.</note>

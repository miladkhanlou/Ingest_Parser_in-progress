   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The subject is that of the first communion of a Negro Child. The composition is placed within an oval shape, a favorite format used by the artist.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This lithograph was printed at LSU. Ms. Durieux ground the stone herself and made the drawing using a lithographic pencil and scraping. The print is on a fine quality rag paper which was quite difficult to obtain during the war years. Since the oval format is a rather difficult shape for lithography printing, Ms. Durieux kept  several stones worked with oval planes ready for use. The artist used scraping to create the white areas of the veil; these white areas serving to create the illusion of the veil's being in front of the face. The texturing in the background is a favorite device used by Ms. Durieux. This texturing also serves to differentiate the planes of the print. The scene is taken from a number of sketches one by Ms. Durieux. At the time she was working on a project for Lyle Saxon in which she made a number of drawings based on the activities of Negro children. Saxon Durieux, Edward Dreyer, and Robert Tallant were working on a book about Louisiana traditions and folklore, Gumbo Ya-Ya.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The cliche-verre is composed of a floriated central mass worked in shades of magenta, ranging from bright to a very deep magenta.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This work has been considered by the artist to be a most "...fun work to do...yet, a difficult work. The print was the result of a simple printingThe fringed are of the composition was achieved by a vigorous scraping away of the emulsionThe scraping done to the matrix resulted in the large negative area surrounding the massThe darkening of the colors was achieved by a double exposure to the light sourceThe first exposure consisted of allowing the entire matrix to be subjected to the light raysThe second exposure required the blocking out of the central massing and particular areas in order to allow for a color darkening of the unprotected areas.</note>

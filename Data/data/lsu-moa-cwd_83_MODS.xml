   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The subject is that of a frail banner as suggested by the central massing of the composition. The banner appears as if it deteriorating.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print is the first collaboration between Ms Durieux and Dr. John Christman, LSU. The print was made using two colors; pinkish brown and greenish brown. Slight variations of these colors result due to the thickness of the emulsion and the chemical reaction of these dyes to the light exposure. Ms. Durieux felt that the subject matter of the print made a symbolic statement if one recognized the banner as a symbol of organization, whether it be that of a nation or whatever.</note>

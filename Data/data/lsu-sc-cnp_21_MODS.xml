   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This view shows the point where stood this regiment forming the left of Adams' Louisiana Brigade, when it charged into the woods south of the fields on the McDonald farm west of Chattanooga road. The white stake is about 300 yards to the left and rear of the stake in the previous view, marking the right of the Brigade. The left of this regiment rested on the Chattanooga road when the charge began, but the resistance being greater there, the right had advanced beyond it, when the Brigade was finally driven back. The position of the Sixteenth and Twenty-fifth Louisiana was to the right of this stake, joining the left of the 13th and 20th Louisiana, and forming the center of the brigade. The road seen through the woods is the Chattanooga road beyond which can be seen the Kelly fields, around which Thomas had his breastworks. The position shown in Views No. 15 and 16 are several hundred yards in rear of Thomas' stronghold. Snodgrass' Hill is to the right front of the Brigade's right.These positions were fixed September 24th, 1894, by the Louisiana and the National Commissioners, and marked and noted by E. E. Betts, engineer of the Commission, in whose field notes they are stated as right of 19th Louisiana line 32-W.-91'-S.-14x22. 16th and 25th Louisiana line 34-W.-18'-N.-15x84.</abstract>

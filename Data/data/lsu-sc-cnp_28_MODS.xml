   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This view shows the position where this consolidated regiment with Govan's Brigade captured and carried off Van Pelt's 1st Michigan Battery, at about 12:30 p.m., on the 19th of September, 1863. The white speck in the center of the field shows the stake marking the center of the Battery's line. The view is facing East; the Chickamauga river is about a mile off near the hills, seen in the distance. The stake is about three-fourths of a mile south-west of Jay's mill, and about five hundred yards North of the direct road from Brotherton's to that mill. In the view, the pyramid seen near the right hand edge, is one of cannon balls marking the place where fell the Federal General P. P. Baldwin. The white monument in the left hand side of the field, marks the spot where stood Battery H., U. S. Regulars, that was captured by Walthall's Brigade and re-taken by the Federals.
This position was fixed by the Louisiana and National Commissioners, General Walthal and Major Govan being present, on September 25th, 1893, and marked by W. A. Wood, of Engineering Department of the National Commission, and figures in his notes as, First Regulars, Line 56-E-96 S 38x52.</abstract>

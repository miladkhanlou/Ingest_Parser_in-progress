   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This view and No. 23, shows the position where fought the 5th Company Washington Artillery at Glass' Mill, on the extreme left of Bragg's Army, on the 19th September, 1863, at about 9 a.m. The white stake, is in an old Indian field, and marks the center of the battery's line, which at the time of the battle extended across the field to the woods on each side, these have since been cleared away considerably on the right. The point is on the west bank of the Chickamauga, about 150 yards from the bank, and Glass' Mill. The enemy was posted on the cleared elevation seen on the left in View No. 22. Lookout Mountain is seen in the distance. This was altogether an artillery fight. The house seen in the left hand corner was standing during the battle, and still shows marks of cannon balls. In this field the Washington Artillery had six men and one officer killed and five men wounded. Cobb's Kentucky Battery was here engaged at the same time; it stood to the right of Slocomb's Battery in the woods across the road shown by the fence. Pieces of shell and many flint arrow heads, were picked up in this field by the Commissioners.This position was fixed and marked by the Louisiana and National Commissioners, and noted by E. E. Wood of the engineer department of the National Commission, but being outside of the Military Park lands, it is not noted with relation to the Park surveys.</abstract>

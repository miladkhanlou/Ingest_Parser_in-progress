   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This view is taken looking west from the foot of the hills on the east bank of the Chickamauga River. The road passing through the fields leads to the crossing of the river, the course of which is marked by the fringe of trees seen in the large field and the one in the far distance. Lookout Mountain is seen above the forest.
The positions in Views No. 26, 27, 28 and 29 were established by the Louisiana and National Commissioners on September 26th, 1894, but being outside of the Military Park limits are not marked in the field notes of the National Commission.</abstract>

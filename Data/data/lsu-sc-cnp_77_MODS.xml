   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Position east of Missionary Ridge, at junction of road running north and south, with road coming from Missionary Ridge near Bragg's headquarters and leading to Chickamauga river, which is beyond the hills seen in the view. This position is about three-quarters of a mile from the crest of the ridge. Here, on the evening of the 25th of November, 1863 Capt. Slocomb, of the 5th Company Washington Artillery, coming from the ridge after the loss of his guns, found some guns abandoned, which had been gotten to this point from the ridge. Manning them with his cannoneers, the Louisiana Brigade, at his call and at that of Major Austin and other officers, rallied around the guns, and the first stand was made here. The enemy was checked, and after a determined onslaught, was kept at bay until the broken remnants of Bragg's left wing had crossed the Chickamauga over the pontoon bridge on this road. This position was fixed and marked by the Louisiana Commissioners September 26th, 1894.</abstract>

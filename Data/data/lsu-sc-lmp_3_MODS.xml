  <abstract displayLabel="Description">1 map : hand col., linen ; 120 x 94 cm.</abstract>
  <note type="content" displayLabel="Note">This hand-colored, hand-drawn, linen map of the Battle of Baton Rouge provides information relevant to the immediate battle area comprising downtown Baton Rouge and nearby areas. The map contains developed areas lying within the confines of the Mississippi River, Florida Blvd to the north, Bayou Sarah Rd. to the east, and Government St. to the south; areas surrounding these streets are marked according to their function or indicate the position of troops. Among the downtown structures labeled are: the old state capitol on North St., the Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, Penitanciary [sic] Grounds, Tunnard's Emporium, and the Harney House. The U.S. Garrison and Arsenal Grounds as well as "property burnt for the defenses" lie within the city. Military positions regarding various camps, brigades, picket stations, and batteries are written in, as well as a line of demarcation where "General William's Line of Defenses" stood. The creation date of this piece is unknown.</note>

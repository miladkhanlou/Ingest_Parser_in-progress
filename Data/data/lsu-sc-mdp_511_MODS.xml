   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The camera stands on the bank of a river looking toward the USS Chickasaw, a 1300-ton Milwaukee class twin-turret ironclad river monitor built at Carondelet, Missouri. She was commissioned in May 1864. After brief service on the Mississippi River, in early July she was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1865, and was largely responsible for the defeat and capture of the Confederate ironclad Tennessee during the later stages of that action. Following the Battle of Mobile Bay, Chickasaw bombarded the Confederate-held forts in the lower bay. She remained on the bay for the remainder of the Civil War and participated in operations to take the city of Mobile, Alabama, during March and April 1865. In July of that year, she was sent to New Orleans and decommissioned. The verso inscribed, "Chickasaw."</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This manuscript, known as the Ellesmere Chaucer, was probably produced soon after 1400. It contains 240 parchment leaves, 232 of which are the text of the Canterbury Tales. The remaining eight leaves were originally blank, lined pages that now contain early miscellaneous notes. The text was written by one scribe in an English cursive script. 

Probably made and bound in London, the manuscript measures 16 by 11 inches and is elegantly decorated. Seventy-one pages contain floriated borders, and most pages bear gold leaf.  Portraits of storytellers are also of interest.  The best known decorative feature of the Ellesmere manuscript is a set of twenty-three equestrian portraits of the storytellers (including Chaucer) who tell their tales during a sixty-mile pilgrimage from London to the Shrine of St. Thomas à Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. 

Although it is not certain who commissioned the manuscript, Chaucer’s son Thomas may have been responsible. Some time after completion, it passed into the hands of Thomas de Vere, twelfth earl of Oxford, and eventually to Sir Thomas Egerton, who, under James I, became Baron Ellesmere.

Rebound in 1802, the manuscript was first made available to scholars in 1846, although it remained at Bridgewater House, the Edgerton family estate.  Henry E. Huntington</abstract>

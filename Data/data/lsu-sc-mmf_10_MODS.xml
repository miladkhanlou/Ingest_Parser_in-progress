   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This work contains 18 miniatures out of an estimated original total of 69, which are distributed irregularly through the first four books of the Old Testament. No part of Deuteronomy has survived. Most of the illustrations occupy a full page and are often subdivided into separate scenes. There are numerous inscriptions within the images. 

The style resembles 6th-century Italian work; a Spanish origin has also been suggested. The manuscript was at Tours in the Middle Ages, where it was consulted for the frontispiece cycles of Carolingian Bibles.  In the 11th century it was used to help decorate the nearby church of St. Julien.</abstract>

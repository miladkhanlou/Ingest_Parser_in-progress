   <abstract displayLabel="Description">One of the finest examples of an illuminated Haggadah, the Kaufmann Haggadah is composed of 2 parts: 14 full page miniatures, and a decorated text. The episodes depicted in the miniatures recapitulate the Exodus story beginning with the discovery of the infant Moses in the Nile and ending with Miriam's song by the Red Sea. Also included is a miniature of preparations for Passover. The text decorations are elaborate, and in addition to the conventional representations of the rabbis in Bene Brak, the four sons, matzah and bitter herbs, they include biblical episodes already depicted in the full-page miniatures. Three artists may have collaborated on the illustrations. Unfortunately, the miniatures were rearranged at some point in the volume's transmission and are now out of order.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Also known as the Pomar Codex, this manuscript was given to Jaime Honorato Pomar, professor of botany at the University of Valencia, by King Philip II of Spain.  The work incorporates many of the discoveries of the physician and naturalist Francisco Hernández (1517-1587), leader of a scientific expedition to Mexico in the 1570s.  Some of the illustrations appear to have been copied from Hernández’s drawings; others may have been drawn from life at the royal botanical gardens at Aranjuez.

The codex contains illustrations of seven animals and twenty-five plants of American origin, including the armadillo, tobacco, bananas, tomatoes, the Indian coconut, and the bird of paradise.  Most of the European plants are medicinal in nature, although there are a few images of decorative plants, including the tulip and narcissus.

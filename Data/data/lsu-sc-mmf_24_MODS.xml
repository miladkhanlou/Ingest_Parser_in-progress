   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A richly illustrated “Moralized Bible,” in LatinThe earliest references to this work are the codicil and testament of Alfonso X the Wise, king of Castile, describing it as a "historiated Bible in three books given to us by the king of France" and "one of the most noble items belonging to the king."  Created between 1226 and 1234, this codex is famous for its almost 5000 medallions, depicting scenes from the Bible 

The three-volume manuscript was probably commissioned by Blanche of Castile, regent of France, and given to her son Louis IX to commemorate his marriage to Marguerite of Provence in 1234Louis in turn gave it to Alfonso of Castile, either on the occasion of the contract of marriage in 1255 between Louis’s eldest son, Louis, and Alfonso’s daughter Berenguela or in connection with the marriage, negotiated in 1266 and celebrated in 1269, of Louis’s daughter Blanche to Alfonso’s son Fernando.</abstract>

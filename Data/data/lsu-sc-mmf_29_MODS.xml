   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A fine example of a Mudejar (Spanish Muslim) binding, this manuscript also features fine filigree ornamentation and calligraphic medallions.  The codex was used by the Spanish Rabbi Alfonso de Zamora, one of three Jewish scholars who worked under the patronage of Cardinal Franco Jimenez de Cisneros on the production of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible and who converted to Christianity in 1506.  	Alfonso wrote in the top margins of all the folios, in his own hand, the Latin names of the books of the Bible and the corresponding chapter numbers.  In the side margins he inserted the chapter divisions which appear in the Polyglot Bible.  At a later date, he removed the titles and numbers in the margin, replacing the former by the original Hebrew names and the latter by rabbinico-alphabetical numbers. 

Apart from some differences in pointing, this manuscript coincides with the Textus Receptus, comprising the whole of the Palestinian canon, with the exception of Genesis 38.24-42 and 16, for which the folios have been lost.</abstract>

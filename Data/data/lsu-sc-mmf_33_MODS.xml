   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This manuscript was produced at the court of Alfonso X "El Sabio" (1221-1284), king of Castile.  The songs (cantigas) are written in Galician-Portuguese, the language of the Spanish troubadours.   In total, 420 “songs to the Virgin Mary” were written at the Castilian court, of which this manuscript contains 109.  It has been suggested that King Alfonso himself may have authored many of them.

Three manuscripts of the Cantigas have survived.  This is the so-called Florence codex.  The work was never completed, and although it contains music staves, there are no notes.  Many of the illustrations are also incomplete.  Depict scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, some illustrations are of an erotic nature, reflecting the troubadour emphasis on divine and courtly love.</abstract>

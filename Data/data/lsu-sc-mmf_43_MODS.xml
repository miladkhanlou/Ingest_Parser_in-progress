   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The portrait pages exhibit both Byzantine/Italian and Celtics styles, while the Canon Tables are primarily Celtic in design.  Overall, the manuscriptâ€™s styles is similar to that of the Vespasian Psalter, although its use of gold, unusual in other British manuscripts of this period, makes it stand out.  Half of the pages have been dyed purple, with text in gold, silver and white; on the plain vellum pages, the text is in black, red and gold.  Other colors found are red, blue, yellow, green and brown. 	

The Codex Aureus has travelled widely. In the ninth century it was stolen by the Vikings and ransomed by Ealdorman Aelfred, who then donated it to Christ Church, Canterbury. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was in Spain, and in 1690 it was bought for the Swedish royal collection in Stockholm and returned to Scandinavia.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This is the earliest known illustrated herbal and contains the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides Pedanius, written ca. 60 AD.  The work is a treatise on the medicinal value of herbs.  Also included are illustrations of various animals and birds.  

The manuscript was made for Anicia Juliana, a noblewoman of Constantinople, whose father was briefly emperor.  It remained in Constantinople (where it may have been used by Hamon, the Jewish doctor of sultan Suleiman II) until about 1570, when it was purchased by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II.  The artist is unknown, but the plant drawings resemble those of the early botanical illustrator Krateaus.</abstract>

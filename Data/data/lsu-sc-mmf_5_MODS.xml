   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The text describes in allegorical language the struggles between good and evil, the persecution of the Church and its members, the temptations of the Devil and the tyrannical rule of the Antichrist.  Evil creatures, including the Dragon, the Beast and their followers fight against St. Michael and the Angels, the Woman in the Sun, and the Army of Heaven.  Good triumphs over evil and the text ends in the establishment of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the appearance of Christ to St. John.  

In 13th-century England, picture books of the Apocalypse became one of the most popular forms of luxury illuminated books.  As texts for elaborate illustration and decoration, only Psalters outnumber the Apocalypses.

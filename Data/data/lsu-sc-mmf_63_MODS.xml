   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Produced for the Monastery of St. Martin at Albelda (Rioja), the manuscript comprises 429 large folios written in double columns.  All three of the illuminators are pictured in one of the miniatures.

The Albelda codex is a compendium of canon and civil law. The main corpus comprises complete accounts of all the general councils, to which were added a selection of canons and decrees by popes up to St. Gregory the Great (540 - 604 AD). It also contains the Fuero Juzgo, the civil code used in Spain from the Gothic period up to the 13th century. 

The work was enriched by the addition of historical and liturgical texts such as the Life of Mahomet, as well as the Albelda Short Chronicle or Calendar, in which we find the first mention and drawing in Europe of the Arabic numerals 1-9. 

The 82 colored miniatures provide views of towns and portraits of famous persons. Although a Hispanic work, the influence of Carolingian miniatures in the illustrations is evident.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Written on parchment, this manuscript consists of 200 leaves, illustrated in color and with gold leaf.  The 150 miniatures depict both men and women (veiled and unveiled) playing chess, dice, and backgammon.  The text documents the introduction of chess into Europe and was probably translated from an Arabic treatise, demonstrating the continuing impact of Arab culture on the Christian ruling classes of northern Spain.

The companion volume includes a complete transcription of the text and suggests that in addition to offering instruction in the game of chess, the treatise may also be regarded as hermetic literature, transmitting knowledge of the Far East.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Mattheus Plateariusâ€™s well-known and lavishly decorated medical treatise is made up of 328 pages, containing 118 whole-page miniatures and 2 quarter-page miniatures. The work, originally written in the mid 12th century, is a compendium of classical knowledge related to the use of animal, vegetable and mineral substances to cure or relieve disease. 

The text is divided into five parts: herbs and flowers, trees and their gums and resins, metals and minerals, animal products, and other materials.  It is followed by 386 full-page illustrations. In addition to the core text, in French, are chapters from works of later periods, during which knowledge of medicine increased. 

Of interest are annotations by 16th-century physicians, voicing their distaste for some of the vernacular terms in the codex, and replacing them with Greek and Latin words.  The manuscript is also interesting for its depiction of plants in diagrammatic (typical of the Middle Ages) as well as realistic styles (foreshadowing the Renaissance).</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Libro del caballero Zifar is the first extensive adventure story to have been written in Spanish and was composed around 1300. It retains traces of the chivalric romances of the Middle Ages and was probably written by Ferrand Martinez, cleric of Toledo, who appears in the prologue. 

Two manuscripts of the story have survived, one from the 14th century (MS 11,309, National Library of Madrid) and one dated 1464 (MS Espagnol 36, Bibliothèque Nationale).  There are also two copies of an edition printed in Seville in 1512. 

The story is divided into three parts.  The first recounts the experiences of the knight Zifar and his family after they are forced to abandon their home.  In the second part, Zifar instructs his sons in the art of kingship.  The third section tells the story of Roboán, Zifar’s son, who has set out on his own quest.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Pinelands pink (center) is an annual, upright plant with several pairs of relatively long, narrow leaves that are quite different from the broader ones that make up the basal rosette Sitting atop its sparsely branched stem are several large, closely clustered, showy flowers, each subtended by a pair of long, leafy bracts Sabatia gentianoides is one of the few species in the genus to have corollas of ten to twelve petals and a yellow, starlike eye highlighting the centers Sgentianoides typically has seven or more petals, while other species in this genus have six or fewer In Louisiana, Sdodecandra (marsh pink) has similar flowers, but its closely associated bracts are the same length as, or shorter than, the petals A few more technical features serve to distinguish these species Pinelands pink grows mostly in wet pine savannas and flatwoods, whereas marsh pink is more abundant along stream margins and in brackish marshes."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p94</abstract>

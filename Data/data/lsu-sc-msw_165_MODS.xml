   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Dodecatheon meadia is the only species of a mostly temperate genus that grows in the southeastern United States In Louisiana, this rare species is known to grow in a few northern parishes, where it inhabits rich, shady woods The leaves of this perennial are clustered at the base of the plant A leafless flower stalk appears in spring and produces an umbel of several, unusual flowers with five delicately colored, reflexed petals and five stamens that surround the style and point towards its apex Cyclamens, sometimes grown in this region as houseplants, show a similar feature and also are members of the primrose family."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p170</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"Spectacular clusters of handsome white flowers of the spider lily dot the wet meadows and ditches throughout much of Louisiana in the springtime The flowers are strongly fragrant, especially in the evening Within the flower, a disk-shaped structure called the corona connects the bass of the stamen filaments and serves to readily characterize Hymenocallis Attached beneath the corona and projecting far beyond its outer rim are six narrow perianth segments that are fused together basally, forming an elongated floral tube Spider lily fruits are fleshy, three-parted capsules with several large seeds This plant's strap-shaped, dark green leaves arise from a bulb securely anchored in the wet, marshy soil Spider lily is an attractive and easily grown garden ornamental Hymenocallis is represented in the southeastern United States by several other species whose taxonomy is poorly known, making the application of the names difficult."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p3</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">"The intricate color and structure of the spiny thistle, a plant common to the roadsides and pastures of Louisiana, can be appreciated more fully by observing this drawing This member of the sunflower family is typical in having small flowers arranged in heads that themselves have the appearance of individual flowers This plant is also called yellow thistle because the flowers are often pale yellow Flowers in this genus typically are purple Many parts of this thistle are spiny, including the many smaller leaves surrounding the heads and the tips of the lobes of the numerous stem leaves Spiny thistle is a biennial It produces great rosettes of long spiny leaves during the winter months and flowering stalks that bolt upward in the springtime Young stems of this species are edible and possess a texture and flavor similar to celery Thistles and their kin are closely related to the artichoke."--Lowell Urbatsch, in the Flora of Louisiana (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 1991), p.24</abstract>

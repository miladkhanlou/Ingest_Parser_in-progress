Like tho great\nportrait painter, who is perfectly skilled in anatomy, he should\nbe able to present men on the canvass of history, with strict\nremrd to those lights and shades, which are found in every\nindividual who is distinguished for talent, and placed in an\neminent station. '\nMr. Sullivan is always the friend to religion, and to the\nureat principles on which society rests. He could not breathe\na thought which would disturb its beautiful order, or which\ncould bo construed, even by a malignant foe, into an attempt\nto array the poor against tho rich, or the weak against the\nstrong. Not all the merit of Gibbon, great as it is, can atone\nfor his occasional departures from modest)', or for his disin-\ng iiii-.us attacks on the christian religion. It is but a poor\napology for a scholar, that he places in a note, or veils in a\nlearned and unspoken language, an offence against purity.\nWe cannot deny to Gibbon, that he has produced an immor\ntal work; but all its splendid merit cannot conceal what we\nregret, for the honor of his fame, that it is not free from\nfault.\nMr. Sullivan has promised another volume, in which he\nproposes !o treat of causes and effects among European nations\nan.! llieir colonics, during the last three centuries. The difficulty of condensing the events of this period into so narrow a\ncompass, and, as he approaches our own time, of making a\nwise selection of facts from tho chaos of materials, will, we\ntrust, only give ardor to his courage and strength to his purpose- But even virtue, to succeed, must have an ample field\nfir action; and it is one of the canons of history, that to be\nperl'iti, it must be limited to a brief and interesting period,\nthat the writer should rigidly adhere to his plan, nnd that In\nshould give to it all the dramatic effect of which itiscapalde.\nMay the laurel be growing, which shall crown the author,\nand best reward his success.\nT\nAN ESSAY.\nTHE K.UKKCTS  01'  RELIGION  ON  TIIK   POLITICAL,   INTF.I.LECTCA1.,    MC\nAND SOCIAL  HTATE OP MAN.\nItrail bsforethoJeffereonCollcge ami Washington Lyceum, Spiit. y,\n1837, by Itnv. II. St. IIiiakk.\nThere is, in the government of God, a wise adaptation of\nlaws to subjects. The laws of the physical world are abso\nlute and irresistible, and, from their combined operation, are\nproduced the admirable regularity and harmony seen in the\nuniverse. Were it possible that one of these laws should be\ninfracted, for instance the law of gravitation, into what confusion and discord would the heavens and earth bo Instantly\nthrown.\nImportant as is the law of gravitation to the order ofthe\nnatural world, it is not more so than are some of the great\ntruths of religion to the moral world: for instance, the knowledge of a Supremo Being, to whom man is accountable.\n\"he knowledge of this truth lies at the foundation of all intellectual improvement and social order. Take this from\n\"tin, and you remove the strongest motive to intellectual culture and moral restraint.    You blot the sun from the universe,\nand unloose the strongest bonds which unite society. You\nreduce man to a mere floating atom, without aim, or end, or\nmotive. But acquaint man with this leading truth in religion, and you, at once, set before him a highcaieer of glory,\nhonor, and immortality. You supply him with motives to\nmoral and intellectual culture, high as the heaven to which\nhe may aspire, and deep as the ruin to which he may sink.\nThese principles, which appear to me almost with the force\nof intuition, have been disputed by many. It has been contended that religion, in all its forms, contracts tho mind, dissolves or weakens tho bonds of government, dissocializes\nman, and, still more strange, weakens moral obligation. Nor\nhas it been the avowed enemies of religion alone, who have\nthus traduced its influence. Professed friends, nnd even real\nfriends, havo been misled by the bold assertions of enemies.\nIt is not uncommon to hear it as gravely asserted, ns if it had\nbeen a thousand times proved, that religion has been the\ncause of more bloodshed than anything else; that it has\ntrammelled free inquiry, and thus kept the minds of men in\ndarkness. Hence the revival of letters has been considered\na triumph of free thinking over religion. The moroseness\nand unsociability of the anchorite, have been attributed to its\ninfluence, nnd even duplicity and fraud have been considered\nits legitimate effects.\nI should consider it an easy task to show that there is in\nreligion, abstractly considered, nothing to produce these consequences. But abstract tendencies are seldom appealed to\non this subject: we nre referred to its fruits, and by this test,\nby their fruits ye shall know them,\" wo are willing (o\nabide.\nBut I would not be understood to present myself ns the\napologist or extenuator of all the crimes which have been\ncommitted under the garb and pretext of religion. Religion,\nas well as patriotism, friendship, and philanthropy, has been\nlaid under contribution to ambition, avarice, and voluptuousness. But so soon as these are admitted to be the governing\nmotives, you clear religion of the crimes, to which it is tho\nunwilling pretext. I am farther prepared to concede, that\nhonest persons have been so far misled, as to commit crimes\nagainst society for the sake of religion; but even this should\nbe set down to the account of the frailty of our nature, rather\nthan to religion, which has not, abstractly, any tendency to\nproduce such effects.\nAfter all the offsets which lukewarm friends, or malicious\nenemies, can demand, I will still venture to maintain, that,\nupon the whole, religion is beneficial to the human family. I\nam disposed to think that this is a truth, if applied in the\nmost extended sense of the term; but it is my purpose to make\nmy observations especially in reference to the Christian religion. I would, however, make one or two general remarks.\nThe first is, that it is very difficult to find points of comparison: as, on the one hand, it is hard to find any community\nholly governed by the precepts of religion, so, on the other,\nit is impossible to find a nation without some of its influences.\nAll we can do, is take the points of greatest divergence. Another remark, which I would make at this place, is, that although heathen religions, the Mohammedan religion, or fills-:\nnotions of Christianity, may have in them many things very\nVOI,.

For who but a\nmilitary man can describe an action as it occurs? who, I say,\nnol well versed in tho science, can describe the many evolutions, manoeuvres, and stratagems of battle, appreciate their\neffect upon the result, and render praise to whom praise is\ndue? As well might the clown who has never had a thought\nbeyond the margin of his father's estate, attempt to tlescribe\nthe manual of chemical analysis, as for the moon-struck poet,\nor the perpetrator of love-sick tales and silly novels, to describe the complicated movements and awful grandeur of the\nbattle-field. England has felt the want of officers, who have\nsufficient talent, taste, and time, to write the history of the wars\nin which they have taken part. And the writer alluded to in\nthe Edinburgh Review, laments this deficiency in lugubrious\naccents, whilst he attacks, with fill the virulence of ignorance,\nthe idea that the time of cadets should bo wasted in the study\nof mathematics, the very basis of all military science. No\nwriter of history, perhaps, at any age, has laid himself more\nliable to the ridicule of military men, lhan Sir Walter Scott,\nin his life of Napoleon. The venerable novelist had been\ntoo long the writer of historical romance, not to tinge this\nbiography with the coloring of fiction. Aside from the silly\nand disgusting extreme to which he carries English prejudice against the French character and nation, he makes some\nof tho grossest blunders, in his allusions to military movements, etiquet and rank. As nn instance, he tells you that\nNapoleon was promoted from Brigadier General to the com-\nmandancy of a battalion, which, so far from promotion, would\nbo a degradation.\nIn naval warfare, the deficiency noticed, is still greater\nthan in the army: and the most magnificent displays of human skill, decision of character, and promptness, are entrusted to the pens of those who perhaps never were out of sight\nof land, and who certainly can have, no adequate conception\nof what they are writing about. If it be urged, that tin-\nBritish navy boasts an exception, at present, in a very popular writer, we would say, in reply, that if a certain Captain\nMaryatt, instead of writing low, vulgar, and unnatural (though\nfunny) novels, challenging critics, and degrading his profession, by leaving,his country to peddle trash to American theatres, would devote his perverted, yet respectable powers, to\nediting a history of British naval actions, England might be\nimmensely the gainer, and wc, most certainly, nothing the\nloser. For we hold, that nothing which ever happened, has\nadded such an impetus to the corrupting taste of American\nnovel-readers, as the writings of the said quondam officer of\nRoyal Navy. We feel safe in offering a guinea for every\nmoral reflection or abstract thought, contained in Japhet, or\nJacob Faithful, which does not carry its antidote in the same\nor adjacent page.\u2014Pardon the warmth which has led mo a\nmoment from my subject;\u2014for the sentiments I make no apology. From the above remarks, it will be found, that the\ngreat objects of military education, are far from being effected in England.\nThe Polytechnic school, in France, is certainly tho most\nefficient institution for military education  in Europe.    The\nmethod adopted for the selection of the cadets, is worfhyol\nall imitation | and calculated, unquestionably, to render the\nofficers of her army tho most accomplished and cfUciem in\nthe world. \"Admittance is not to bo gained by favor, or t|:(,\nhighest interest and recommendation, but by merit alone.. 'J ]it.\nmembers are selected from the provincial and preparatory\nschools, where tho pupils undergo, yearly, a strict examina.\ntion. The competition is great and public; and it is scarcely\npossible that any youth should obtain the wished for entrance\nwithout superior industry, talents, and knowledge.\" The\nPolytechnic school is, as its name indicates, the theatre where\nmany arts are learned. In addition to the course of ninihe.\nmatics and exact sciences, which are more thoroughly taught\nhere than in any European university, the cadets learn several blanches of manual industry, such as carpentry, arehi.\nlecture, masonry, &amp;c; and not from diagram and theory, but\nfrom the manual application of theory. They are also taught\nin the modern languages of the nations, whose proximity and\nimportance render it necessary. This is the more essential,\nas their soldiery is composed of men speaking so many Languages. The ancient languages are, as they should be, considered of minor importance to the military profession, as ils\ntechnicalities are neither Latin nor Greek, nor is the military\nofficer likely to come often in contact with men who speak\nexclusively either. ' Natural science and drawing constitute\nan important department; and all things which tend to the\nperfect development of tho physical system, are alternated\nphilosophically with study. Thousands of the ablest candidates are thus led, by the certainly, if successful, that government will permanently provide for them, to propose themselves candidate: for election; and all the rays of national\ntalent are thus concentrated upon military science. Napoleon, who left his mark for weal or wo, wherever he tied,\nwas a cadet of a military academy, and the Polytechnic\nschool is a prouder monument to his memory than the field of\nAusterlilz. Would that his conqueror at Waterloo, another\noffspring of a military education, had shown the same gratitude to the origin of his greatness I The objects of military\neducation have been eminently realized in France, though\nonly one hundred and fifty officers are yearly graduated.\nThis is sufficient to supply the army with efficient engineers,\ngunners, and architects, though not sufficient to fill the vacancies of their immense army.\nWo have already hinted at the United States' Military Academy, nnd its origin. Wc shall proceed to show how, and in\nwhat degree, it effects, in the army, and in tho American community, the objects of its creation. Admittance is gained by\nwarrant issued by the Secretary of War, with the advice and\nconsent of the President. They are based upon recommendations, usually presented by the representative in Congress\nfrom the district of the applicant's residence. The maximum\nnumber is two-hundred and fifty, chosen from tho States in\nproportion to representation in Congress. Preference is\ngiven, (ceteris paribus, to the sons of revolutionary soldiers,\nand distinguished officers of the late war. No other preference is known, and I feci called upon to say, from actual\nand careful examination, that the proportion of cadets, sons\nof distinguished men, or politicians, is habitually small: no1","fullrs":{},"find":"493.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2010-10-08","dmmodified":"2010-10-08","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"492","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"1867006","cdmfilesizeformatted":"1.78 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

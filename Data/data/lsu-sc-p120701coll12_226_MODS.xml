the slight wound of the rifle ball had served but to rouse him from his lair, and wake\nup the fierce energy of his characterBelying, perhaps,\nupon an instinctive consciousness of their own power,these\nanimals never go any great distance from the place where\nthey are first disturbedConsequently, we soon came up\nwith him again, and fired four rifles at him in quick succession, all of which took eflect; but there is a tenacity of life\nabout the feline species, that sometimes verifies the adage,\nthat cats have nine lives; for notwithstanding the tiger appeared lo have been rendered poweiless by the leaden missiles that had entered his body, as we approached him, he\nspeedily evinced that he was neither dead, nor his nature subdued : his fierce rolling eyes flashed defiance, and he sprang\ntowards us with a ferocity that indicated a determination to\nsell his life at the price or human sacrificeI was tremulous with apprehension, lest he would attack the unprotected\nHindoo, who was seated upon the head of our elephant; for\nvengeance was depicted in every movement; but he could\nnot withstand the repulsive power of the rifle balls that were\nrapidly fired at him, and, bristling with agony and rage, he\nretreated to a small cluster of trees, where he awaited our\ncoming with an aspect of dogged enmityWe fired upon\nhim again, as we approached, when, as if aroused by the incarnation of a dozen demons, he made a fierce and terrible\nassault upon us, and, uttering a savage growl, he sprang upon our elephant, and buried his sharp teeth and claws deeply\nin the fleshy proboscisThis was a moment to me or indescribable excitementBut the sagacious creature upon whom\nwe were mounted, did not wait to be lacerated by the vindictive weapons ol\" his foe; for, quicker than thought, lie hurled\nhim to the earth, and then, planting his ponderous foot upon\nthe body or the tiger, crushed him to deathThus terminated our tiger hunt, and f now have in my possession the\nenormous head and skin vi' this animal, that were preserved\nas- trophies ol' the exploit.\nThe day after our adventure down the river, I was invited\nto visit an antique looking ship, belongingto the government\nol' Cochin China, which had but just arrived for the purposi\nol' c igotiating some facilities of trade between the East Indie\nCompany and the Cochin Chinese, but instead of gratifica\ntion, which such a visit at any other time would have afforded me, I was doomed to encounter one of those revulsions of[\nfeeling, that the members of oil' profession are too often call\ned to experienceOn board was a young man, who had\nbeen employed in the capacity of navigator, and while coming up the river he had been nssailed by the terrific scourge\nwhich in that country carries off its thousands and tens of\nthousands, and whose destroying besom more recently visited our country, spreading desolation and woe through our\nstreets at mid-dayHe had partially recovered from the first\nshock of the disease, but had fallen into that typhoid condition that not unfrequently ensues after reaction1 saw him\njust as the flame of life was flickering in its socket, emitting\nthose vivid and transient bursts or light which indicate the\napproach of a speedy and total extinctionHe informed me\nthat ho was an American, rrom the neighborhood ol' .,\nand impelled by the feeling of satiety that some limPS I(,|.\npossession of young and ardent minds, had left his home and\nkindred to seek for that pleasure and happiness which be\nhad regarded as an entity to be found and then to be possessedHe was disposed to dwell upon the premature intorrtin-\ntion to the career which his fancy had marked out for him\nand decorated with the most pleasing anticipations; not however with a spirit of animadversion upon the unphtlosophi-\ncal tendency of his imaginings, for he still clung to the belief that this world contained all the elements necessary for\ncompleting the measure of man's desiresAll reference to\nthe future was received with gloomy apathy, and he evinced\na painful contempt in the belief of any consequences that i\u201e.\nvolved a misery more poignant than what he endured in being thus abruptly cut off from the world and its flattering il.\nlusionsThe feeling with which he looked forward to his\ncoining fate, was not that of resignation\u2014there was no pious\nquiescence in the justice that had marked the unavoidable\nnature of the event which he saw rapidly approaching  He\ndesired me to take charge of his effects and to communicate\nto his friends the mournful intelligence of his demise, and\nthen he spoke of dying among strangers anil in a strange\nland, with no eye to pity, and no soft hand to smooth hit\naching pillow and wipe from his cold brow the death drop\nthat had settled there, and in spite of his efforts to maintain\nomposure, the thoughts or home and kindred, of a sister's\n;entlc solicitude, and a mother's tremulous affection, wrung\nA-oni his susitic heart lamentations that entirely upset all our\nabstract notions or manly seff possession   But he died, and\nat sunset we followed  him to his grave, and as  we lowered\nhim to his vesting place in  the cold earth, the moon rose to\nbed her consecrating rays upon the spot where his last sad\nites were solemnized.\nThe short limits or an essay, forbid the notice or many\nplaces of interest that wc visited, and the many incidents that\nwere witnessed during my stay in Calcutta, each or which\nwould demand a separate and lengthened accountIn the\nmean time, between business and pleasure, the time passed\nrapidly away, and after bidding adieu to the pleasures or the\neast, our ship was again loosed from her moorings, the anchor weighed, the sails unfurled to the breeze, and every\nheart beat high with the anticipation of a safe and speedy\nvoyage home, but we had not escaped from the dangerous\nsand-heads of the Hoogly, when one of the terrific storms of\nthe south-west monsoon, burst upon us with all its furyThe\nvery spirit of the tempest seemed unloosed and the waters of\nthe deep were shaken to their foundations;

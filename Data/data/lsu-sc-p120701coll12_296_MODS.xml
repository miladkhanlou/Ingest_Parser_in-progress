Editor:\nIn your ninth number, (which I have but recenlly examined) there is a \"Sketch of a Visit to India, by S. C. Mei-\nwin, AI. D.\" Il is written in a very sprightly style, evincing no ordinary ability in the author. Home ofthe incidcnls\nare very inters'.iug, and calculated to enlarge our knowledge\nof the inanin rs an 1 customs of a country where civilization\nis in ils dotage, The whole would have give n me unmixed\npleasure but for an incidental allusion to the christian missions established in that country. I have long deplored, in\nc.ammon with all the friends of missions, the slow progress\nwhich Christianity is making on tint strong hold of idolatry;\nand with the Doctor, I am ready to admit, thai the conduct\nof the professors of Christianity has net been the least hindrance to the progress of tiiith ; nnd even among those who\nhave gene ns mi-sionaiiis of the cress, there have doubtless\nbeen some who havo not adorned the ge spe 1 of Christ by\ntemperance, humility, and deodncss to the woibl. The case\nspecified by Doctor Merwin, is a melancholy instance. Il\nis the first that I havo heard, though there have no elouhl\nbeen more. Human nature would have lo be greatly changed from what it was in the days of our Lord nnd the Apostles, if out of so many missionaries there should be found no\nJudas to betray his muster, or Demus, who would lovo this\npresent world.\nAfter these painful and humiliating concessions, I must\nstill think that Dr. Merwin has fallen into a very common\nerror, that of inferring generals from particulars, or slill\nworse, judging of men from the representations of their enemies. I admit, for I have neither the right or inclination to\ndispute the testimony, that Dr. Merwin did see in his Boston\nfriend a gross departure from christian simplicity. Does it\nfollow that hundreds of other missionaries do the same thing-\nf think not. Anel suppose he did hear 'seme humorous stories' of tho 'happy' (I would rather say unhappy)'versatility with which some ofthe rigid promulgators ofthe\nchristian faith have relaxed in their observance of the stern\nprecepts of religion,' is it certain that there was in ibesc stories as much truth as humor? I think not. Were christians nnd christian ministers in our own country judged o\nby the same rule, we should form a very unjust estimator1\ntheir character.    I must say that if the Doctor was as unfor\ntunate in his other acquaintances as in his missionary\nfriend.","fullrs":{},"find":"569.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2010-10-08","dmmodified":"2010-10-08","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"568","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"1752153","cdmfilesizeformatted":"1.67 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

      <title>Edward J. Gay letter, 1861 January 17</title>
  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Edward J. Gay was born to Sophia Mitchell Gay (1793-1869) and John Henderson Gay (1787-1878) in Liberty, Bedford County, Va. The family moved west to Illinois then settled in St. Louis, Mo., where they resided on Union Avenue. In 1834, Edward J. Gay graduated from Augusta College in Kentucky and entered the family mercantile business in St. Louis. He then joined the St. Louis factor firm Glasgow and Gay, which he later left to form his own wholesale grocery business, Edward J. Gay and Company. He operated that business until the outbreak of the Civil War. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gay married Lavinia Hynes of Nashville in that city in 1840.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was his marriage to Lavinia Hynes that brought Gay to Louisiana, for she was the daughter of Anne Erwin Hynes and Andrew Hynes, a Nashville merchant who acquired an interest in his father-in-law's plantation, Home, located in Iberville Parish near Plaquemine, in 1836. When Andrew Hynes died in 1849, he owned one of the largest sugar plantations in Iberville Parish and 223 slaves valued at $86,000. Gay, acting as administrator of the Hynes estate, took over the management of Home Plantation. About 1856, after having purchased the interests of the other, Gay built a new residence at Home and changed the name of the plantation to St. Louis &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the Civil War, Edward J. Gay and family remained for the most part at their Louisiana plantation, and he continued to engage in the purchase and sale of sugar and cotton. After the war, Gay expanded his financial interests through the purchase of a partnership in the William Edwards and Company, a New Orleans factor house, and the acquisition of additional plantations by sales and foreclosures of mortgages.</note>

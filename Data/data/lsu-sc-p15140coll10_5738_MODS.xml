      <title>Esther Wright letter, 1857 April 19</title>
  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Esther Gertrude Wright (1844-1915) married (1865) David French Boyd (1834-99), who spent much of his teaching career at Louisiana State Seminary, later Louisiana State University, where he was Superintendent and President.  The Wright family and their relatives are notable for their management of plantations in Louisiana, their contributions to education and their military service during the Civil War. The Wright family owned property throughout Louisiana and Texas. Originally, the family of Jesse and Sarah Wright lived at North Bend plantation, Rapides Parish, but after Jesse Wright's death, his wife and younger children moved to Greenwood (Rapides Parish), owned by Sarah Wright's son-in-law, Leroy Harvard. After the Civil War, family members remaining at Greenwood (Sarah Wright, Mary Wright and, later, Sarah's sister, Ann Foland) divided their time between this plantation and the homes of Esther Wright Boyd in Baton Rouge, La. and Auburn, Al.</note>

  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Henry Vignaud, born in New Orleans, La., was a newspaper editor before the Civil War. Commissioned a captain in the 6th Louisiana Regiment, he was taken prisoner when Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 but escaped to Paris, where he assisted in John Slidell's Confederate mission. Vignaud contined to live in Paris, serving as secretary of the American legation from 1875 until his retirement in 1909. A scholar and book collector, Vignaud built an extensive library of Americana and gained an international reputation as an historian for his work on Christopher Columbus."
Eugène Dumez, journalist, was born in St. Juste, France, and participated in the French Revolution of 1848, emigrating shortly thereafter to Louisiana, where he worked as a publisher and editor of the French-language newspapers Le Meschacb and L'Avant-coureur.</note>

He reports receiving letters from Lefranc (whom the addresser views as overly optimistic) and Lematre that are encouraging for Louisiana (if not for the South) because they relate that civil government is going to replace military rule in the state.  He proposes bringing back the Meschacb and taking over the Renaissance.  Dumez envisions writing a history of Louisiana with preparatory work done in the fashion of Franois-Pierre-Guillaume Guizots and Jean-Joseph-Franois Poujoulats studies.  He spells out the ways in which Vignaud could work with Dumez in future endeavors.  Dumez mentions Gurards bibliography.  He asks Vignaud to see A. Callaud of 41 Rue St. Georges for Lieutenant Lefort of the Catinat.  He mentions Rameau and brings up the Martin affair.

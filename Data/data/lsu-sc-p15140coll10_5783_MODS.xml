  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Henry Vignaud, born in New Orleans, La., was a newspaper editor before the Civil War. Commissioned a captain in the 6th Louisiana Regiment, he was taken prisoner when Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 but escaped to Paris, where he assisted in John Slidell's Confederate mission. Vignaud contined to live in Paris, serving as secretary of the American legation from 1875 until his retirement in 1909. A scholar and book collector, Vignaud built an extensive library of Americana and gained an international reputation as an historian for his work on Christopher Columbus."
Eugène Dumez, journalist, was born in St. Juste, France, and participated in the French Revolution of 1848, emigrating shortly thereafter to Louisiana, where he worked as a publisher and editor of the French-language newspapers Le Meschacb and L'Avant-coureur.</note>

Dumez tries to cheer Vignaud, reminding him of literary and political possibilities and still encouraging him to see Chavanne and Rameau.  He refers again to Duval as editor of the Journal des Economistes.  He states that Slidell and his associates do not appreciate Vignaud as they should and criticizes their approach.  Dumez relates learning from the Renaissance that St. Paul has encouraged Confederate Congressman Lucius J. Duprs founding a newspaper in Paris on the order of the Index.  He gives his opinion of the Revue Nouvelle and mentions the Renaissance, Meschacb, and Autographe.  Dumez refers to a smallpox outbreak, which has affected his wife.  He asks if the letter from Jonathan Slingsby to Robert J. Walker published in London and mentioned in the Renaissance is by Slidell.  He extends his best to Boulet and mentions the Mmorial.

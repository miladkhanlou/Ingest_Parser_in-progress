      <title>John Quitman letter, 1850 October 2</title>
  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Samuel A. Cartwright was a physician in Mississippi and professor at the University of Louisiana in New Orleans. During the Civil War he served as a Confederate Army physician."
In 1849, John Quitman was elected governor of Mississippi and from the beginning of his term favored secession as a means of guaranteeing the continuation of slavery. As an advocate of Cuban liberation from Spain, Quitman entertained revolutionary leader Narciso Lpez in Jackson, but declined his offer of command of the revolutionary army. He was indicted by a federal court, however, for violating United States neutrality laws in favor of the insurrectionists, and resigned as governor. When the charge was dropped, Quitman ran for Congress and was elected on March 4, 1855. He was reelected for a second term but fell ill and died at his plantation, Monmouth, near Natchez on July 17, 1858.</note>

In this manner the boat is carried in pieces \\rjft\nits load along the rail-ways. On arriving at the canal, the pieces are\nunited, so as to form a continuous boat, which, being launched, the\ntransport is continued on the water. On arriving at the rail-way\nthe boat is again resolved into its segments, which, as before are\ntransferred to the rail-way trucks, and transported to the next canal\nstation by locomotive engines.\"\n4.

The charge of transit on the Ohio river, by steamboats, is about hifr\ncent per ton per mile.\nThe disadvantages of the New-Orleans route are set forth by Mr. Cabel!, of Virginia.\nmany of which are capable of being removed, and all are, no doubt, greatly exaggerated.\nThe dangers of Mississippi navigation, and higher rates of insurance thereon\u2014storms and\nhurricanes of Gulf of Mexico\u2014injurious effect of New-Orleans climate on produce, Ac\nHe says the mercantile men of Richmond had better pay -2 cents per ton to Richmond\nthan come free to New-Orleans, because of climate, rates oi' dray age, storage, insurance,\ncommission, &lt;fcc.; and even freights from New Orleans, which are often 50 per cent, higher\nthan from Richmond.

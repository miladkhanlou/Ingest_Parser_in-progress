We lie down at night upon a volcano, which, in an instant, may hurl death and destruction in our midst. It is idle then to say that rail-roads\ncannot compete with steam upon these rivers. Upon their very banks the travel, and much\nof the trade, would be at once taken off by such roads.\nMr. Chambers, of St. Louis, furnished a year or two ago the list of steamboat accidents\nin twelve months, which showed 59 3teamers, or more than one a week, destroyed ; 245\niives, and $590,000 property, exclusively of personal effects. This was a favorable year,\nas the loss of life lias since reached 500 or more. The dreadful experience of New-\nOrleans is in confirmation. How frequently, within the last few months, has the work of\ndeath been consummated at our levees. The whole number of steamers built on western waters, from 1830 to 1847, says Mr. Burke, in his Report to Congress on \" Boiler\nExplosions,\" is 1,915. The losses by explosions alone amount, according to the returns,\n(admitted to be altogether imperfect,)  during the same period, to 198, or about 10 per\nPUBLIC LANDS FOR INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.\nNote, p. 4.\u2014Government, by virtue of its proprietary, being benefited by the construction of roods, has pursued, to some extent, the liberal system of donating alternate\nsections, &amp;c., in their aid. In the last two or three years many splendid donations have\nbeen made, particularly to the Central Road of Illinois and the Mobile and Ohio road. The\nwhole amount donated in this way, up to 1847, was 6,693,781 acres, which has since been\nfiled to ten or twelve millions.    The aid to be obtained from public lands for rail-roads\nspecial to the southern and western states, and is an element of immense consideration,\n''n^e'hy the latest report we have access to, there were remaining 25 millions acres public lands in Ohio, about the same in Indiana, 38 millions in Michigan, 16 millions in Iowa,\n^millions m Wisconsin, 35 millions in  Illinois, 43 millions in  Missouri, 33  millions in\nKansas, 30 millions in Mississippi,  28 millions in Louisiana,  32 millions in Alabama,\nmillions m Florida. Total in these states, nearly 400,000.000 acres, which, by the late\n&amp;ounty and other grants, has been, perhaps, reduced to 300,000,000 acres.\nRAIL-ROAD PROGRESS IN THE WORLD.\ntween'P' 5,~Thetotal amount of rail-roads now opened in Great Britain (1851) isbe-\nhavin    U even thousan&lt;i miles-    Tlie total miles in the world, in 1849, was 18,656,\nproffTP C\u00b0f nearly ^2,000,000,000.

His inaugural is a declaration of their doctrines; andt^\nauthority of his acts is tested by reference to the opinions of those who elected him.\nThe action of the Representatives in Congress is determined by the opinion of ^\naggregate representative population, divided amongst the several States according fa\nthe ratio determined on. The Senator obeys the original or modified expression of t^\nnumerical majority which he represents. Aggregations of men constitute new Stat\u00ab,\ndetermine their own municipal system, and demand an equal voice with those win,\nformed the government. The Judiciary adopts the popular expositions of law through\nthe conformity required in Executive appoiniment.\nPractically, then, our government is a democracy, embodying in its legislating\nadjudication and policy, the doctrines of the numerical majority which composes it.\nThis is a tendency inevitable from the principle of the organization and distribution\nof power under the provisions of the Constitution. Now, since the acts of a numerical\nmajority can only be controlled by the diffusion of intelligence and morality, or hy the\nimperative consideration of reciprocal interest; since the relative power of the sewn!\nStates is, by the written law, according to their comparative population; since the\nnumber of inhabitants must be determined by the climate, social and industrial\ninducements presented by the several States; it must follow that the States comprising\nthe Southern section of the confederacy should devote themselves to the acquisition of\nthis peculiar element of political power; and that for the purpose of obtaining this\nresult, they should provide for the employment and mental improvement of their population, all those facilities which are presented by competing sections. They will thus\nacquire a more potent voice in the common councils, and will create interests s&gt;\nreciprocal and so vital, that the ascendancy of numbers \"will be modified, and even controlled, by the considerations of an increased intercourse and a common interest.     ,\nWhilst results historically stated would indicate that the people of the Republic-a\nthe source of power and the bestowers of patronage, must prescribe the administratioB\nmost acceptable to them\u2014they elect Presidents, modify duties, determine systems^\nfinance and foreign policy\u2014a comparison of the original power of the several section'\not the Union will snow that the acquisition of wealth and numbers by the Northern\nStates had changed entirely the relative portions of these sections. Certain physical\nnecessities compelled the North to rely rather on human energy than upon climatic\nadvantages; ingenious industry supplied the want of material resources; and as J*\nincidental result to efforts in themselves laudable, a preponderance of political power\nhas followed their successful prosecution of these enterprises. If I were required\"1\nrefer the foundation of Northern power to a particular era, it would be to that in wtt\u2122\nthe commercial presence of a Clinton projected the Erie Canal. That the politic*\nconsequences of this system of internal commerce were not apparent, at that peri*\nto the people of the North, is shown by the odium which for a long time visited &amp;\nwise design of that statesman. But the consequence of this enterprise has been to\nstimulate other interests of the North to compete for the internal commerce; and w*\nErie Canal may be regarded as the fruitful mother of the various lines with wto*\nBoston, New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore connect themselves with the interior\nIf .we deduce from this system of Northern developement the precise representation\nlegitimate to the several industrial interests which it has created, we will find ^\nfrom manufactures, commerce and its consequences, have resulted a positive rep**e#D'\ntative power sufficient to control the common government.\nThe population of the principal cities and villages ofthe Northern and Northweste81\nStates is, according to the last census, more than three millions ; yet these are, w\nthe present ratio, entitled to thirty members of Congress.

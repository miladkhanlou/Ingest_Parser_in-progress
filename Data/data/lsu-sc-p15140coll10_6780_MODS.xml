Cincinnati and Louisville, instead of\nthe city of New Orleans.    If there be any stagnation or relative decline in New\n1 ans it is because, owing to the want of a rapid and certain communication with other\ntons of the Union, it docs not receive the full return in merchandise for its exports,\n, ioses the profit upon the sale and distribution of that merchandise, taking for its\nhare of the trade of the Valley the factorage of the staples, whilst the merchandise\nconsumed in the interior is ordered from New York or Europe, and distributed from the\nValley cities, and pays its profits accordingly.    Now, if New Orleans and the South\nWest could order their goods by rail, they could be   received direct, the delays and\ndangers of coastwise shipment would he avoided : and the freights, instead of being paid\nto the shipowner, would enable the South Western Railroad to transport the staple\nproducts to their own seaport cities.    There may be a difference of opinion as to the\neffect of such a railroad upon the prosperity of the city of New Orleans; but the road\nwill be certainly made, and the immense expense of coast fortifications, insurance, and\nthe delays of navigation, will ultimately compel the adoption of an inboard line of mail\nand merchandise transportation from New Orleans to New York.\nBut there is another reason why the prosperity of the commercial  interior of the\nSouthwest has not prospered.    It is the Want of a constant intercourse between the\nseaport cities and the producing interior.    The geographical estimate is that there is\nabout 20,000 miles of navigable rivers connecting with the Mississippi,  and ostensibly tributary to New Orleans, yet it seems that these streams are unnavigable for a\ngreater or less portion ofthe year, so that for much of the period the upper country\nof Red River, Washita. Pearl, Yazoo, Arkansas, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, Tombig-\nhee. Alabama, are cut off from all communication with the cities at their mouths, and\nmust depend upon the supplies of merchandize stored by the country merchant or open\nnew connections across the Atlantic States with the commercial cities of the East.\nJnder the modern system of artificial communication no section of country will be\ncondemned to employ a river which is interrupted during a considerable period of the\nyear.   If the city legitimately entitled to its trade will not vouchsafe any thing better,\niere need be no surprise if after the many months of interrupted intercourse with\nfib interior friends it shall be found that they have struck hands with some enterprising Eastern interest which offers the usual facilities of a daily mail, an express\nand a telegraph, and that their seaport trade is even preferring the artificial to the\nnral routes.    Especially is this probable with the States whose staples fluctuate in\nce and depend so much upon the time when they can be placed in market.    Suppose\n\u2022o ton planter, much of whose crop is baled in September, whilst the stream which\n\u00abr it to market does not rise until January, or even later ; suppose an advance\n:otton\u2014how tantalizing must it be to know that, but for the want of facilities of\nstation, a price much above the average might have been realized, when the\nry of the crop is accomplished under a heavy decline. Would it not be better for\ntbp subscribe the difference between the highest and lowest prices to secure\nduring!\"8 \u00b0f immediate delivery in future?    And when the supplies of the  interior,\nsame non-intercourse, advance until they are worth any price that avarice\nrned to\nI it not\nand c\ncost\"       ,med to ask&gt; and when much of the supplies must be purchased at a heavy\nfrtah* j    lt; not be better for a district so isolated to communicate  directly with\n\u2014P supplies, and escape monopoly and extortion?     It is in this point -\nP\u00b0rtin la- COmmunicati;,ns by railroad between the southwestern interior and its im-\nj(*&gt;bo    i ieS become indispensible, because, whilst it has been common to criticise the\n\u2022\u2022hoochtJ commerce of the North during the winter, no one has thought that the\nound intercourse of the South has been just as great an evil.

It will he seen, by referring to La Tom .\nMap, that a right line from Algiers to Thibodeauxville would be impossible, without crom '\nthe river. By commencing at Verret's Canal and passing as above described, it runs on 2\nbest route, without interfering seriously wilh any of the plantations.\nThe straight line from Millaudon's to Bayou des Allemands was chosen, as being the ^\nfavorable ground, and as running to the best point for crossing the Bay on \u2014 there being iW\nislands there; from thence to Thibodeauxville is an experimental line, and subsequent ion-.\nmay possibly cause the route to piss a mile or two further north. The distances havenoti)\nyet been measured: the aggregate will not vary far from fifty-one miles. The nature of |L\ncountry is, from Verret's Canal to Millaudon's, cypress swamp, good foundation, with mjih\nof crevasse water from nothing to three feet. From Milladon's to Bayou des Allemandi &amp;\ncept the first two miles, may be ealled the Great Prairie. It is twenty miles long,andui\nlow marshy prairie, interspersed with narrow ridges, a few inches high, and its northern to-\nder pierced by ridges not subject to overflow, A detailed survey of this country is required,\nto connect these ridges, so as to determine whether a deflection of the line would be advisaifc,\nthe growth upon the prairie is reed grass, from ten to twelve feet high, and saw-grass neath\nas high, and both so luxuriant as to be very difficult to pass through. I was eight hoursgonj\nsix miles through it, with two stout men to beat it down before me; and the surveying jwik\ncannot go over three or four miles per day. The ridges, on the border, are well wooded;ai\nthe cypress bottoms also extend some distance beyond the line, at several points. TheMilii\ngenerally moist, but firm enough to bear up men at all times, and cattle in dry weather. He\nsoundings gave me hard clay bottom at ten feet depth; this is a general feature of theprairi-,\nin its whole extent; but there are some places which appear to be the beds of bayous chokd\nup, which are very boggy, and impossible to cross on foot, but can be got over by crawliij\nor by light bridges. There are portions of the prairie called \"Trembling or Floating Pitf\nies,\" but not to any great extent on the line, or near where it should pass. They are prise-\npally in the south-west portion of the prairie, between Lukes Washa, Catawasha, and Iittk\nLake des Allemands. They are, in my opinion, small ponds, which, being protected frofflp\nwinds, by the rank grass of the prairie, have been overgrown wilh weeds until suffieiul?\nfirm to bear a man's weight. The thickness of the crust is about eighteen inches, and I*\nwater underneath about ten feet deep, with hard bottom, corresponding with the firm ft\u21221'\ntion of the prairie. The prairie is kept wet by the water from the lakes being driven up\u00bb\"\nby high winds. Its luxuriant vegetation indicates its richness; and, if properly leveed*\"\ndrained, it would be most valuable farming land. In its present condition it is only a hutiui\"\nground for the planters and others.\nThe route of the line is intersected by numerous bayous, some of which run into toe \u00bb**\nand others lose themselves in the prairie.    Up to this time, the \" Prairie\" has been &gt;\nincognita to most people, and represented as impassable in every direction.    Although I\nbeen around, and across, and even under it, I am not prepared to give a full map of its'\na so**1\nshowing all the canals, bayous, ponds, floating prairies, and forests ; and much more\nsurveys should be made, to make such a map as is required.    The best time for such a\nis in the winter or spring, when the reeds are burnt off\", and the mosquitoes are lesS\ndant\u2014and with men wilh iron nerves and constitution.    The Prairie, on the west\nBayou des Allemands, is only four miles wide, and is of the same character as on the eas\nBayou des Allemands, at the points of crossing, is above three hundred feet wide, i\"\nem shoot, with twenty feet deepest soundings; and two hundred and fifty feet i\u00ab l'ie   .\nshoot, with  fifteen feet  deepest  sounding.    The island is   one hundred and ninetf\"\nwide \u2014 firm land, without timber.    The current is affected by the winds, which cau*\"8\nfall of about two feet.    From Bayou des Allemands to Bayou Bceuf is cypress swamP\u00bb     ^\nbayou, with the prairie between.    From Bayon Bceuf west is four miles of cypress, g1\"","fullrs":{},"find":"2192.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2191","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"611441","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.58 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

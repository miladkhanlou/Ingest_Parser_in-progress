no levee can be built that would endure long, as required for a railroadThe foundation must, therefore, be a frame work of iron, or wood, six feet above the general level of\nthe route.\nIron is too expensive for the present, and must therefore be replaced by cypress ; which, if\nproperly chosen from the low lands, will last long.\nThe expense of constructing this portion of the road, will be much heavier than farther\nWest; and must be estimated, at least, $15,000 a mileThis estimate would have to be made\nat the same rate to go up the river, as the nature of the country, between the points of the\nriver, is the same as a portion of the straight line\u2014namely, cypress swamp and prairie ; and\nihe distance between the points, in the aggregate, would be nearly, or quite, equal to the\nstraight line routeI assume, as a matter of course, that a straight line is the line to be\nchosen, if practicable   And I have not varied from it, except for good reasons.\nTime has not been sufficient to make such a detailed survey, as the magnitude of the work\nrequires; but when it is considered, that since* the 2d of December, there has been at least\n'#miles measured out of 50, on which the line runs ; and, considering the difficulties of sup-\npying the surveying parties with provisions, I hope that the Committee will see that the\n'\u25a0fork has been pushedOut of 27 days, I have been 20 days actively engaged in the field,\nata\" '\"nes engaged in the business of the survey   MrThompson has not lost a day\nce ne 2d of December, except by circumstances unavoidable, and he is still in the field,\ng leave to recommend him and MrGillespie to your favorable notice, for perseverance\nM&lt;1 energy.\ne been brief in this report, as I only arrived in the city this evening ; and, of course,\ne expected to make a full report, or prepare a map ; butif desired, I will make them\n'\"'\"'wptriod.\nJ satisfy the mind of the public, several routes ought to be explored   For instance,\nthin tk *ieat' \u00b0^ ^a^e des -A-llemands, which would be seven  or eight miles longer\n^ ^ight line  Another route up the river, to a ridge about twenty miles above the\nihe B -S '*\"* ridfie to the Bay\u00b0u des Families, the shores of Lake Washa, and along\nh-fibb 3tla ^anaJ*t0 the eastern ridge of Lafourche, which would also be longer, but would\nfmm A] ProPer to remark, that as the Convention decided that a railroad should be built\nteferred '* t0 ^Pe'0U5aa&gt; ai\u00bbd my instructions were to run a portion of this line, I have not\n'^ Jack   * \u00b0f a r\u00b0ad to end on *ke \"ver above New Orleans, or  to cross over to meet\n*\u00b0\u00abld b \u00b0n rai'road' *&gt;ut would merely suggest that the expense and delay of such a road\nictior&gt; 0   ?*eater than by a direct route to Algiers   The Mississippi is too uncertain in its\n1 \"banks, and its rise and fall too great, to permit us to think of any construction to\n4","fullrs":{},"find":"2193.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2192","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"576509","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.55 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

This, then, is the actnBt\ndebt of the state\u2014an amoun.t for which she is at present unable to provide, but insjnj^c\ncant when viewed prospectively, and can easily be provided for, after a correct system\u00ab*\nrail-roads shall have developed \"our vast natural resources.\nAs yet, private enterprise has done nothing efficient towards a system of rail-road; and\nthe state, as shown above, is not in a condition that her credit can be made available u\nin other states, to assist in projects of improvement. But an awakening spirit, on tLU\nsubject, has recently manifested itself; and the important inquiry is heard on every band,\ncai r Arkansas do something towards a general system of rail-road improvement?\nPrivate enterprise and capital stand ready to act to the full extent oi\" their ability ; vet\nin the present advancement of Arkansas this is not sufficient, al least so far as capitatj,\nconcerned, to prosecute to completion the system necessary. The only resourceswe\nhave in addition are from capitalists in other states, and the liberality of the general gov-\neminent in making donations of lands fur railroad purposes. We think we present more\nthan ordinary claims on the government, in our proposition to point our improvements toward the Indian country. These Indian tribes are under the protection of the govern-\nnient ; large quantities of specie to the amount of millions, have annually to be transported at great risk, and frequently at heavy expense, (land carriage having to he used,) to\npay the Indian annuities\u2014besides troops and munitions of war have to be sent there to\nkeep in proper subjection tbe turbulent spirit of the various tribes. Besides, a direct line\nof rail-road, penetrating the Indian country, would do more to civilize and Christianize\nthem, than millions spent in the usual missionary efforts. With this view, we see the general government is directly pecuniarily interested in our railroads, ns well as phiW\nthropicaliy, and possesses the same interest in ours that she does in the roads running\nthrough other new states. A donation for so much land on each side of the road, with tbe\nprivilege of floating for it, would enable Arkansas to do much towards completing her\nroads.\nIn the selection of a starting point on the Mississippi River, we find central on the\neastern border of the state the high lauds touch the Mississippi at Helena; and it is s\nfact that may not be generally known, that this is the only point from Cape Jeridon to\nthe Balixe, where the high lands touch the Mississippi on its western bank. And by\nreference to the operations of the states on the east bank of the Mississippi, we find that\nall their rail-roads point to tbe bluffs for their termini: instance Memphis, Vicksburg,\nNatchez, and other places. This, of itself, is conclusive that high land points ought to Deselected for our termini, in preference to swamp and overflowed ones, when they can be\nhad.\nThen, if we adopt Helena (the only practicable place) as the starting point of our system, we find the projected road from there to Little Bock to pass over a plain country,\nalready a grade above overflow, (with the exception of four miles of White Hiver bottom,! rich and fertile, with timber of the best kind for the superstructure, aud with no cost\nfor the right of way. Taking this as the first section of the main trunk for the system for\nArkansas, we know of no road, in the South or West, that offers such inducements to\ncapitalists for safe and profitable investment. This road, a distance of 110 mih\nconstructed with al rail of 58 lbs. to tiie yard, at a cost of $1,000,000.\nWe think we risk nothing, when we base an estimate ou 30,000 through pa\nthe first year; this, at $6 each, gives us   $180,000., with tbe certainty of an annual increase to an ultimate extent that now baffles calculation.\nWhen we take into consideration the large extent of country that will send il\nto market over this road, and receive in return its merchandise, we at once set down tae\nfreight receipts as more than sufficient to pay the expenses and repairs ; giving the receipts from passengers as profit, making 18 per cent, on the investment.    And when tne\ncontemplated extensions and laterals are constructed, it wdl pay to an extent that 0\"g\nto satisfy the most avaricious.   It will also possess the advantage that, for years at leas -\nit can have no rival.    The enormous cost, and uncertainty in investment, over\nflowed bottom, will prevent any  rival route from being constructed,   giving to tins\nbenefits of all the trade and travel of northern, western, and southern Arkansas ; also, ^\niiitli Missouri, northeastern Texas and the Indian country, without saying anything\nits being a part and parcel ofthe great Southern Pacific Hail-road.

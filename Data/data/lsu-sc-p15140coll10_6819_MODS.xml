This committL   ?*\na laborious  and faithful examination, reported a route terminating at Lake Provi!\nThis road, according to  that report, was cut out, and the cost paid by an approp3^\nfrom the state.\n2d. In 1848, I believe, the legislature still feeling tbe importance of this road, and\nsatisfied with what it had done to forward the developments of the resources of this T'\nof the state, or promote its interest, passed an Act requiring the state engineer (S\nWooldridge, to examine three routes from Monroe, for a road, to intersect the river\nVicksburg, Milikin's Bend, or Providence, and report. Col. Wooldridge, after hark!\nexamined the three routes carefully, reported in favor of Providence. This report I w\nendeavored to obtain, that I might submit it with this, but have not been able to jy\ncopy in tbe city. The report was made to the legislature, and of course will be fouad 1\nthe seat of government.\n3d. The interest felt in this road has not been confined to the State of Louisiana aW\nCongress, in 1849 or '50, made an appropriation for the survey of routes from the ValW\nof the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean; under that appropriation W. H. gS\nwith an appropriate corps of engineers, proceeded to examine tbe countrv that lie* between tbe Lower Mississippi, in Louisiana, and the great bend of tbe Reel RiveriaAj.\nkansas. (Capt. SidelFs report is herewith submitted.) This report relates immediate**\nto this route.\u2014Although this survey was made to intersect the Red River at Fulton, the\nsame ground will be passed over by a road from Lake Providence to Shreveport, so tarn\nFarmersville, as though it went to Fulton. The road from Farmersville will be mad\ncheaper and easier made than a road from Farmersville to Fulton ; the farther south m\ngo, after leaving Farmersville, the lower the hills, and of course fewer and shallower cuts\nto be made.\n4th. This road is now, and has been, for four or five years, traveled by thousaudW\nemigrants, and passed over by wagons and every description of carriages. This fall, fin\nwagons, on an average, per day, have loaded at Providence with merchandise, botrodto\nShreveport, Bastrop, Farmersville, and other places contiguous to this route; cotton bat\nbeen hauled to Providence in considerable quantities, from all the above named places, to\nProvidence.\n5th. The route which I am contemplating, will pass,'as nearly as practicable, On I\nstraight line from Shreveport \"to Providence, passing through, and running contiguous\")),\nthe parishes of Bossier, Caddo, Claiborne, Jackson, Union, Washita, Morehouse, ai\nCarroll, in Louisiana, beside several counties in Arkansas and Texas, which would beat-\ncommodated by this road; thereby affording'the greatest facilities to the greatest number!\nof any other route contemplated.\nIn conclusion, I would remark, that tbe feeling on the subject of this road is Ten Br\ntense in all the northern part of Louisiana and Southern Arkansas\u2014that meetings dm*\nbeen held, and delegates appointed to this Convention\u2014proceedings of meetings in \u2022\u00bb\nparishes on this line of route I have seen published; and I would be glad if I had theffl\nthat I might present them to your honorable body, as the delegates themselves, by f\u00bb\nvery low stage of water and bad roads, have been prevented from being personally pi*\nent. .\nI have been able to find but the report from Union parish, which is herewith submiSWi\nalso, the remarks of the Minden Herald on this subject. Many other reasons c\"?^*\ngiven to show that this route possesses advantages over all other routes from \"^v.\nport to the Mississippi River; also the great interest felt in, and preference giyen!*^\nthe inhabitants of Northern Louisiana, this route over any other ; but, U11W ^\u00bb 7,u,\nyonr patience any further, and believing that I have said enough to induce your yj. t\nnotice of this route, I submit this report without any further remarks. All of WW\u2122\nrespectfully submitted.\nB^3 This road will be from 150 to 160 miles long.\nM. B.

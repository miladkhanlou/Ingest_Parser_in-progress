C, November 30, 1850.\nSir:\u2014Having been engaged by you, under the appropriation for the \" survey\n,     (\"eg from the valley of the Mississippi River to  the Pacific Ocean.\" to ex-\n'ne so much of the route as lies between the lower Mississippi, iu Louisiana,\n1 d the Great Bend of Red River, in Arkansas, and having completed the work,\nnave now the honor to report:\nEarlv iu April I left Washington for the work, and on arriving at Louisville\nwilh mv principal assistants, Messrs. J. K. Ford and S. Thayer Abert, proceeded\nprocure the equipment for the survey there. The floods of tiie Mississippi at\nthat time covering the whole bottom land, it became impracticable to commence\n[besurvt-y at that extremity of the line, as originally intended ; and, with your\nassent, I concluded to begin at the other end and work eastward. The party\nwas accordingly dispatched to Fuiion, by the way of the Red River, near which\npoint I joined them, having taken my route by the way of the Arkansas River\nuudthe road from Little Rock to Washington, in Arkansas.\nThe party had been at work a week when J joined them, from which time I\ncontinued iu direction of the work.\nThe country traversed between Ihe Red River and the Washita is hilly. Between the Washita aud tbe Mississippi level it may be described more particularly\nthus: At Fulton the Red River is about eight hundred feet wide, with banks\nabout as high as the level of high water, and presenting no obstacle to bridging.\nThe course of the river is at first south, and afterwards east.\nAt about a quarter of a mile back from the margin of the river the ground rises\nabruptly twenty-five feet to a table-land, which continues to the Bois d'Arc (or\nBoclock) river, about eight miles, as we ran obliquely down the Red River\nvalley.\nThis stream runs southerly, and enters the Red River -about ten miles below\nFulton. Beyond tbe Bois d'Arc the country is billy, with frequent appearances\nof rock. The Bodcom and Dorcheat are two other streams running southerly into\n'he Red River; the first of which we cross at twenty, the last at forty miles from\nfulton, as we ran ; and these are the last Upper Red River streams which we\nmeet.\niv i^r '^ese there are two other streams, running eastwardly towards the\nWashita\u2014the D'Arbonne on the south, or our right, and the Smacovert on the\njwth, or our left. Presently the D'Arbonne inclines to the southeast, and the\neadsof another stream appear\u2014the Loutre, which runs southeasterly into the\nW^iv ' a \u00b0' course enters that stream above the D'Arbonne ; then comes the\nem -a' ,llllI\"nD southerly; and near where we cross it the Bayou Bartholomew\nj. m rt-from a general direction of northeast, although for the last three miles of\nsouth'1'80 'l 'S S0 kent ''rom 'ts general direction as to enter the Washita from the\nl|lew,Sl,'.t'ie VVashita'and Bartholomew being both navigable. At this point on\nMis \u25a0 \u25a0 - l'le '\"\"y country, with rock, ends, and the alluvial \" bottom\" of the\nflJ'^'PP1 begins, but at a level of sixty feet above tbe bed ofthe Washita.\ntiines\u00b0-e ,lp,lllfi 1&gt;i\"lk of\" the Bay\u00b0u Bartholomew, the land is above water at all\n6vb J-i     . at Bastrop, near where we leave this stream, the country, for four or\nI\u2122les-\u00abhigha\u201edundulalrag.\ndenly ?\"\" ee hiiles beyond Bastrop, the hills on which it stands falls off sud-\nihree o f plaC&lt;^ Called Re(1 Hil1' and at the foot ot tllis come8 Prairie Mer Rouge,\nPr8irier|h U\u00bb m\"'es acr\u00b0ss, beyond which, and scarcely below the level of the\nriver8 h e ' swamP'\" or land subject to overflow, appears.

This ground is inhabited and cultivT?\nand, according to theevidence of the well-diggers, has a substratum of rock i\nis called tbe \" Mason Hills,\" and, increasing in height as we proceed eastw Ji\nterminates in a bluff on the Bayou Mason. These hills are said to extend ami\nand south many miles, though not at all places above the floods, or continuoml,\nabove the ordinary swamp, as we found them on our line. Beyond the Bavll\nMason the swamp land continues eight and three-quarter miles, to the hank of\nLake Providence, formerly a bend of the Mississippi, but now a pretty crescent,\nshaped lake, with its banks above the highest floods, and beautifully cultivated\nBetween the Bayou Mason and the lake are several streams running from A.\nlake, the principal of which are Baxter's Bayou, Drew's Bayou, and the Tenai.\nAt the foot of the lake, on tbe bank of the Mississippi River, stands ihe town of\nLake Providence, the terminus of our work, but the commencement ofthe\nsouthern route from the valley of the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean.\nI have described the country in the order in which we surveyed it, as it is not\nan independent work, but the first link of a line to the Pacific. I will diacasi\nthe location in the reverse order\u2014that is, beginning at the Mississippi and run.\nuing westward. ,\nThe line run over the ground above described, and the reasons which influenced\nus in adopting it, may be stated thus:\nThe proper place for crossing the Washita was assumed to be just below Ihe\nmouth of Bayou Bartholomew, which is much further south than would be by*\nstraight line drawn from Lake Providence to Fulton ; but above that point the\nriver has much bottom land subject to overflow, as is particularly the case near\nthe state line, where, for an extent of sixty miles, there is no landing place from\nthis cause. Besides this, it was an object to avoid an expensive bridge to eras\nthe Bartholomew, which, being a navigable stream, would require a draw.\nHence we aimed for the most direct practicable route from Providence to the\nmouth of the Bartholomew, and thence to Fulton. As my orders required an\nexamination with reference to a rail-road, as well as to a common road, I willd*\ncuss the first, on which a detailed estimate has been made, and from which tbe\nlocation and cost of a common road may be deduced.\nBy much inquiry it was ascertained that tbe most favorable point for leaving\nthe Mississippi River in that vicinity was at Lake Provideuce, about seventy\nmiles above Vicksburg, as the Mississippi swamp is here comparatively narrow,\nand, for a portion ofthe distance, some elevated land is found. Many emigrant**\nfor the southwest pass through Lake Povidence, and the route seems to \u00ab\ngenerally recognized as a proper one. The town is on the river bank, at the foot\nan old bend of the river, now a lake, and is a pleasant place of about five nuntlr*\ninhabitants. Behind the town is the \" swamp,\" intersected by several bayous,01\nthe elevated margins of which are some fine plantations. The banks ot the I(*\nbeing above water, have several beautiful residences. No plan is proposed\nferent from those in ordinary use for the depot at the Mississippi terminus-\nSuggestions have been made for opening an entrance from the river to the\nand establishing the depot on its bank ; but, although this would S1V\u00ae * j\u00a3\nexcellent basin, difficulties, arising from the great rise aud fall of t^e.]]rive!'^aj\nswift current, and the loose character of the soil forming its banks, wm P ,\nany measure of this kind being attempted without mature reflection- \"^\nwharf-boat, securely moored, with inclined planes reaching from its deck ^\nlevel of the ground above, will be sufficient, at least fur the beginning' (\narrangement is not worse than the simple hoisting, common at many ,n)P ,^\ndepots. Sufficient depot accommodation may then be formed on the lev8' ^\nvillage, and in its immediate vicinity. From this point we carry the I\u00bb'e ^\nthe bank of ihe lake, which runs* favorably for three miles; thence J^^\nswamp, which extends to the Bayou Mason, and which is called the ''^^\nSwamp.\" Through this swamp several streams How, which are escapes j^\nlake: the principal are the Bayous Tensas and Batu. They will be ct**' ^\nbridges, as I propose for all the streams, large and small, which run \"ir0 gcwaiap\nswamp ; the reasons for which will be giveu hereafter.

In this\nthe cars, locomotive engines, turn-plates, and machinery, would have a\nirifermity that would ensure a facile adaptation,  and change from one road to\n^ ther.    Two of the longest and most important roads in the world use the\n^wide 'gauge\"  the Erie, and the Russian road between   St. Petersburg and\n' Brery one looks with certainty to the early construction of the projected railroad from New-Orleans to Jackson, Mississippi; thence running west to intersect\ntbe two great trunk lines between Memphis and Charleston, and Mobile and\nChicaffo, the former now urging to completion, and the latter in rapid progress of\nconstruction. Yet there is one suggestion in regard to the New-Orleans and\nJackson road, which I may be pardoned for makingat this time, in order that the\ncompany having it in charge may, at the inception of the work, make adequate\nprovision for doing t he business that will certainly press upon it with greater force\nthan the most sanguine will at this time anticipate. Such has been the experience\nupon the great Erie Rail-road, that even thus early, (not yet six months in\noperation,) the directory are casting about to make provision for another track.\nLet the road-bed be constructed for a double track, that as soon as the rails are\nplaced upon one, the other may also be in a state of preparation for the rails, no\npractical mind will doubt that the transportation and travel upon this line will\njustify it, else New-Orleans must perish iu her efforts to advance, by the acquisition of renewed commerce, traffic and travel from that portion of the country\ndrained by the tributaries of the Upper Mississippi. In that mode, the company\nwill not only be amply prepared to accommodate all the business that may concentrate there, but to invite it from other numerous competing avenues. The\ntime has come when timid, or doubtful half-way facilities for trade and travel, will\nwither promote nor satisfy the enterprising march of all the commercial and\nindustrial pursuits of this advancing age.\nThere is no time to be lost: let the capital and energies ofthe people, both in\nMississippi and Louisiana, sufficient to build this road, be combined and concentrated, and the work pushed forward with vigor to an early completion.    Per-\n: ime to tell you, Louisianians, that one fatal step now will forever blight the\nsT Latlon \u00b0^ your anticipations of making New-Orleans the queen city of the\n^ h has now become a settled question, that the rich commerce of the West,\n\/awn oft to the Atlantic seaboard by the numerous artificial lines of canals and\n^ads, already in operation, and in process of completion, can never be re-\nWand brought back to find a market through former channels; hence the\ner the necessity for tbe South to enter at once into the field of operation, for\ninto a\"8\"11^ systern of internal improvement, best calculated to create and bring\neveryC\"V!t^ a'lcJ use^alnesa the combined means and energies of the   people of\nme\u2122Con'1ty, city, town, and village, in each of these states.

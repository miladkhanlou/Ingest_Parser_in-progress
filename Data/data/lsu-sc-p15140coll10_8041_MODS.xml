Martin), of which three Conner boys (the Lemuel Conner family) are members and that he is drawing applications for it from Mississippi and Louisiana.  She remarks that companies are forming and she is still unhappy about the war:\"\"what a price to pay [men enlisting] and for what?\" She admits that the aggressiveness of the North has done more to reconcile her to things than anything else.

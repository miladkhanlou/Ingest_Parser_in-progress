   <note type="content">'Not until the mid-1880s did Lytle Studio advertise expertise in outdoor photography. At that time Andrew would have been in his fifties. His son, Howard, who joined the studio in that era, may have been the driving force behind this new facet of the studio's work. This two-plate panorama of oak trees with Spanish moss is an example of the occasional wit Lytle expressed in his images. Notice the man who stands in the foreground' – Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D. Lytle's Baton Rouge: photographs 1863-1910, (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2008), p. 91.</note>

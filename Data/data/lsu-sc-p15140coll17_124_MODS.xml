   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Washington Mardi Gras Ball began as a way for Louisianans living in Washington to enjoy the traditional Mardi Gras festivities away from home.  After sporadic celebrations in the 1930s and 1940s organized by the Louisiana State Society, a D.C. social organization of native and adopted Louisianans, the ball has been held annually since 1953.  The chair of the event is chosen from the state’s congressional delegation.  In 1957, Senator Russell Long was chair, and in an effort to enliven the party, he created the Mystick Krewe of Louisianians.  Twenty years later the Krewe was incorporated as a non-profit organization and continues as the official sponsor.  The Washington Mardi Gras has grown to a three-day series of events that highlight the state’s food and culture, hosted by Louisiana’s members of Congress.  It features multiple parties, attendance of queens of Louisiana’s festivals, and the presentation of the king and queen and Mardi Gras princesses, most of whom are drawn from Louisiana families.  The ball is completely self-sustaining with costs covered by the sale of tickets, corporate donations and krewe memberships.</abstract>

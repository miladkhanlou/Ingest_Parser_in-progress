   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains four letters from June 22 through July 3, 1919, three of which are from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  Moyse returned to Baton Rouge and writes to Gottlieb about various work-related trips to New Roads, Livingston, and New Orleans, Louisiana.  In a letter dated June 30, he mentions that he will be formally joining the law firm of Cross &amp; Moyse the following day.  In the same letter, he writes that he has received various invitations to speak about his war experience and has accepted one such invitation at the state penitentiary, provided there is no mention of it in the press, for he decided he has "already had too much press-agenting."  The fourth letter in the folder is from a fellow soldier named C. J. Bordeaux.  Still stationed in France, Bordeaux writes to Moyse to update him on news of mutual acquaintances (July 3).</abstract>

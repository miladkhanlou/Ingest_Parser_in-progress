   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains six letters from July 21 through August 12, 1919, five of which are from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The sixth letter is from Debora Abramson, who writes to Gottlieb to let her know she is taking a trip to New York (July 21).  In his letters, Moyse writes with various news items of mutual acquaintances, including engagements, deaths, and visits from old friends (July 21, July 28).  He also mentions business trips he has taken as well as dinners he attended (August 10).  On August 12, he writes to Gottlieb on the occasion of her birthday, wishing her "a year of unequaled joy and happiness."</abstract>

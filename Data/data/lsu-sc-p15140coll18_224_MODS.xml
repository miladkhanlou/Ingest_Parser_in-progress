   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains ten letters from November 5 through December 30, 1917, seven of which were written by Hermann Moyse during his time at Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas, and two of which are from Moyse during a brief trip to New York City before his departure for France.  Eight of the letters are to Rosalie Gottlieb and one letter is to Moyse's sister Harriet Sommer.  The tenth letter is a Special Order from Lt. Colonel E. H. Dearmond, dated December 22, 1917, dictating that Moyse report to the Commanding General, Port of Embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey, "prepared for extended field service."  In the letters from Camp MacArthur, Moyse describes his experiences there, including his bayonet training course, which he particularly enjoyed.  In a letter to Gottlieb dated November 13, 1917, he writes "I wonder if the fact that the French slang phrase for the bayonet is rosalie has something to do with my liking it so well?"  In the same letter, he mentions a visit from several French officers, describing their brightly colored uniforms and genial nature.  In another letter to Gottlieb dated December 17, 1917, Moyse writes of a football game between Camp MacArthur and Camp Funston (Leavenworth, Ks.), during which three bands played 'The Star-spangled Banner,' leading the twenty thousand soldiers present to rise 'en masse with right hand at salute to pay tribute to what the national anthem means and represents', calling it 'the most stirring patriotic display' he had ever seen.  Other letters mention mutual acquaintances and recent LSU football games.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains six letters from April 27 through June 2, 1918, from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  Moyse mentions his eagerness to experience trench warfare and writes that the censor prevents him from telling Gottlieb too many details about the work he is doing (May 26).  In his letter from May 5, Moyse tells Gottlieb how much he misses her: "If you would know how often you are in my thoughts you would realize that I don't need the Dodge sedan, in which I usually ride these days, to carry me back in spirit to 701 Convention St.  It very often happens, however, that while the old Dodge is taking me up a wonderful French hillside road and I am looking down into a magnificent valley below, I am really not seeing French soil but a little corner of Louisiana many miles away."  Praising the stoicism of the French people in a letter from June 2, Moyse writes, "[W]ar can't break the spirit of men who have such a love of country sunk so deeply into them."  As for people who say 'that this war is unbearable, that it is about to drive them crazy,' Moyse advises Gottlieb to "just tell them that civilians have lived under the shadow of guns for almost four years, that soldiers have faced the enemy's fire for that same length of time, and that, despite these facts they are living tranquilly and attending to business.  Just one more thing, tell them - if they want to end this war, get into it with both feet - mobilize America's workmen just as her soldiers have been mobilized."</abstract>

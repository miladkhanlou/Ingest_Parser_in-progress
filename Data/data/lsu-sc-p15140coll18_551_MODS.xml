   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains seventeen letters, dating from August 26 through October 17, 1918.  Fourteen of the letters were written by Hermann Moyse, twelve to Rosalie Gottlieb and two to his brother-in-law and sister, Lep and Harriet Sommer.  The folder also contains a letter from a fellow soldier named Bill Weine to Moyse (September 15), and two general orders from October 11, one of which is signed 'By Command of Brigadier General Rosenbaum: M. Bienstock, 1st. Lt. Inf. U.S.A., Adjutant.'  The general orders describe the ceremony scheduled for October 12 at which Moyse received the Distinguished Service Cross for an 'act of extraordinary bravery,' namely, leading a 'patrol of five men forward to capture two machine guns which were endangering success of the operation.  Although seriously wounded in the chest and foot by machine gun fire, he would not consent to being taken to the rear until the guns were taken.'  In the letters to Rosalie, Moyse writes that he is making a steady recovery from his battle wounds and is enjoying his stay in a chateau belonging to a wealthy American couple who opened their home to convalescing soldiers.  He also mentions having fought at the Second Battle of the Marne (September 11).  In a letter dated September 15, Moyse praises the resilience of the French people, declaring they are "bound to come out of this war with the greatest credit and the greatest admiration of the entire world, Germany included."  Moyse also describes how he was injured in battle and how difficult it is to put into words what combat is like (September 19).  Mentioning that he has been selected to receive the Distinguished Service Cross, Moyse writes, "there are so many acts of bravery in every scrap that it seems just a bit unjust that only he who, thru some chance of fortune comes a bit into the limelight, should be rewarded.  Many a man who lost his life that day undoubtedly earned the Cross far more than I, who as a matter of fact, did only what any American officer would have done" (September 25).  In a letter from October 16, Moyse describes the ceremony on October 12 during which he received the Distinguished Service Cross.</abstract>

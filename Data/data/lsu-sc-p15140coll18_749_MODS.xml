   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains four letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb from November 28 through December 11, written from Tours, France, where he was working in the Office of the Adjutant General.  In a letter dated November 28, Moyse wishes Gottlieb a happy Thanksgiving, declaring "we can all find plenty today for which to be thankful, for we may even be thankful that those who were taken away gave themselves in so great a cause."  He writes that he has finally fully realized that the war is over and that he is eagerly anticipating his return to Louisiana (December 2).  In a letter from December 6, Moyse mentions having run into eight fellow soldiers from training camp at Fort Logan H. Roots, and marvels at the noticeable change to the town of Gi√®res ("acres and acres of storage warehouses, miles and miles of switches and spurs, an ice plant, with a refrigerating plant attached, bakeries, and heaven only knows what") due to the American presence in the region.  Moyse describes his visit to a local museum in Tours, as well as to the Cathedral of Tours and the Basilique St-Martin.  Although he enjoyed his visit of the town, he relates that he is less interested in 'things' after having experienced war, and while he acknowledges that "war is horrible [and] its sufferings terrible," he does not "believe that a man who has been through it can help but be the better for having seen its horrors" (December 11).</abstract>

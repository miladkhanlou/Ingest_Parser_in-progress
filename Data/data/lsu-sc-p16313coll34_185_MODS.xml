         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, writes his mother, Gabrielle Trénonay Duplantier, declaring that Mr. Maxan, through whom correspondence passed, was taken to Jamaica as prisoner.  The writer repeats information sent earlier, as it seems his letters have not all reached intended recipients.  He says that he came to Louisiana in April 1781, whereas Claude Trénonay's March 30, 1781, letter indicates a March arrival.  Duplantier mentions having married his uncle's stepdaughter and praises her good qualities.  He attests to having heard of the death of his uncle 'Montfera' and relates the loss of his first child shortly after her birth.  The addresser states that his wife is pregnant and that they would like the addressee to be the godmother and to supply the newborn's name.  Duplantier speaks favorably of Louisiana but says the colony needs peace in order to sell indigo at good prices.</abstract>

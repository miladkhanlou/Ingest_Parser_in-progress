         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, tells his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, that Améle Duplantier, returning to Louisiana, has brought the recipient's news.  The addresser expresses sorrow upon learning about the addressee's wife's accident.  He relates that his daughter Louise died the previous November 17 and describes her expiration.  Duplantier addresses questions his cousin has about Spanish land grants mentioned in Armand, Sr.'s April 25, 1822, letter and the writer's own August 26, 1826, letter (which he mistakenly attributes to 1825) and offers reasons for his delay in responding.  The addresser describes the roles of Mr. de Lassize (Mme. Avart's brother) and Mr. de Marigny (both men 'personally known by Louis-Philippe, your king') in rallying on behalf of 'all the old French families of Louisiana' in the land matter.  He expresses frustration and pessimism over the United States government's handling of the property issue.  He accuses the government of prejudice against Louisiana-French Creoles and cites two laws designed to populate the state with Anglos and diminish the prominence of Creoles.  He relates how the discrimination has caused him to have to work hard all his life and come to the aid of others, rendering him far less affluent than persons such as Mme. de Castellino think him to be.  In closing, the addresser refers to a package of insects sent to the addressee through Perret.</abstract>

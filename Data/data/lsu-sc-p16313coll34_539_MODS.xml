         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Duplantier, Jr., Paris, writes his aunt Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, Vorion, France.  He indicates that both addresser and addressee have not received all of the letters that they have sent each other, a problem that almost everyone in the family consistently voices.  Duplantier states that he has heard of the recipient through his father and his brother Guy.  The writer expresses his pleasure upon knowing that his female cousin will be marrying a Tivollier, the addressee's brother's son.  Duplantier echoes his father's April 25, 1822, letter when speaking of problems that Louisianians are having with the United States' failure to recognize Spanish land grants, and he expresses the hope shared by his father that Congress will clear up the matter.  The addresser indicates that Hippolyte Tivollier is the addressee's nephew and that he is no longer associated with 'P….' [Perrin?] but with Mayer in Baton Rouge.  Duplantier reports that of his brothers, Fergus has been married for a long time but without children and that Guy has been married for six years to a relative.  The writer goes on to say that Guy has a brickyard near New Orleans and four children.  He speaks glowingly of his own wife and gives frank appraisals of his four children.  He states that his older daughter, fifteen years and four months old, is named Célestine.  He describes her appearance and qualities and relates that she is fluent in spoken and written French and English.  He describes the appearance of his second daughter, Louise, as well, noting that she is thirteen years old and in Paris.  He notes that his sons are six and three.  Duplantier suggests sending mail through Henry in Le Havre and Fortin in New Orleans.</abstract>

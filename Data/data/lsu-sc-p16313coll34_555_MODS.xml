   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Concitoyen Desvignes Cousin, Lyon, France, provides Monsieur Pascal, Voiron, France, an excerpt from Jacques [Tournier? Tourine?]’s July 18, 1792, letter from New Orleans describing Claude Trénonay's death.  The quote states that the victim was supping with his manager, his surgeon, and his business manager when one of his male slaves, spying through a window, shot Trénonay dead without saying a word.  The account relates that the slave escaped but returned to his cabin the following night and hung himself.  The statement records that the presence of accomplices is not known.  The value of Trénonay's estate is given and reference is made to the deceased’s brother in Paris (who was 'trésorier du Receveur des Finances') and 'another [brother] in Dauphiné with a sister.'  Below the writer's signature appears 'ancien hôtel d’artois #8.'</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Henry Mortimer Favrot, Baton Rouge, thanks his cousin Antoine Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, for initiating a correspondence, care of Am√©lie Duplantier.  He excuses his delay in responding to his having to study for 'college' exams.  The writer says that he will help his uncle Armand Duplantier, Jr., collect and preserve insects for the recipient, and he extends greetings from his father, mother, and sister.  The addresser sends his best to his 'Aunt Allard' and conveys his step-uncle Joyce's fond memories of time spent among the addressee's family.</abstract>

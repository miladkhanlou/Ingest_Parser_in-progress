         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In another's hand, Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes a 'dear brother' in Europe, addressing him with the formal 'vous.'  Trénonay acknowledges receiving the addressee's May 26, 1782, letter but not the one sent through Mr. Manaut, who may be imprisoned in Jamaica.  He states that his correspondence will pass through Mr. Falze and Ostend.  Trénonay indicates that he has more than one sister, one of whom is Madame Guimard, whose finances are discussed.  He asserts that he learned of the death of his brother (called 'Montferra' in the postscript) only through the addressee's letter and asks the recipient to represent him in the succession, alluding to the succession of an uncle in Voiron, France, as well.  When recounting problems that an unnamed person is causing the family, the writer quotes Cicero's famous line to Catilina: Quo usque tandem abutere patientia nostra.  Trénonay states that the recipient's nephew Armand Duplantier married the writer's stepdaughter three months after his March 21, 1781, arrival at Trénonay's, and he describes the couple's economic situation.  He discusses Miss Masse's succession held in Louisiana by a Mr. Broutin and expresses his desire to sell all his possessions and return to his relatives.  He mentions the recipient's wife and daughter and expresses joy on hearing of Mr. [De Bord?  De Bard?]'s advancement.  Trénonay asks the addressee to procure for him from an ambassador a letter of recommendation to the governor of Louisiana so as to facilitate exit from the colony.  He requests peas called 'pois Lombards,' which he says the recipient has at 'Chamfret,' along with notes on their cultivation.  Penciled on the back appears 'Allard de la Louisiane.'</abstract>

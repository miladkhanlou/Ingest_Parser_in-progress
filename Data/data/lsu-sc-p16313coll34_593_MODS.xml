   <note type="biographical/historical"
         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes his brother-in-law Joseph Allard Duplantier, whom he calls 'dear brother' and addresses with the formal 'vous.'  Trénonay announces that the recipient's son Armand has two handsome sons and that 'Armant' will be sending a portrait of his wife as well as one of the older boy.  Although at the time Trénonay is unable to sell his possessions and leave a country that displeases him greatly, he asserts that he wants to return to Europe as soon as possible.  He discusses the economic circumstances in which he finds himself and relates how slaves fit into it.  The addresser says Armand left Trénonay's house a year ago to reside a league away on his own plantation.  He recounts that whereas he did not want Armand's family to leave, rarely three days pass without their seeing each other, and they are more advanced with their indigo than Trénonay was upon his return from Europe.  Trénonay describes and seeks help for an eye problem, complaining against the absence of a doctor or good surgeon in the colony.  He states that he learned of the death of his brother 'Montferra' from Lagoyette (who seems to be the 'dear brother' addressed in the April 21, 1783, letter) and that the latter has not responded to Trénonay's letters, some of them concerning Montferra's succession.  The writer relates that Mr. Bureau in La Rochelle and Miss Masse in Paris, through whom Trénonay formerly sent correspondence, are both dead.  The author discusses the means, places, and persons through which to send correspondence, one of them being Mr. Poupet in La Rochelle.  Trénonay states that he has requested seeds from  Lagoyette and that he is fatigued by the latter's silence.  He mentions the recipient's wife, Madame Guimard, and Mr. Prévieux.  Trénonay relates conditions that could be leading to war between the United States and Spain as well as their effects on the economy and speaks disparagingly of Anglo-Americans, whom he considers worse than Amerindian 'savages.'</abstract>

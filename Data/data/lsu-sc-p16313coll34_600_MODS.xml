   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, discussing the ways to send correspondence to Louisiana, the seeds he has received from France, his finances and business affairs (including slaves), indigo, and an eventual exit from the colony He mentions his late brother Montferra and the fact that the recipient's son has two children He relates his eye problems and states that he is still bleeding sick slaves Trénonay discusses 'Chanfret,' which he learned his brother in Paris would consider transferring to him, and he explains how the vicinity of Moirans, France, would not suit him after having spent the greater part of his life in a 'country of liberty.'  He insists that, contrary to popular belief, the Spanish government (at least in Louisiana) is not hard and that the colony enjoys more freedoms than 'English America' does He claims that the people in Louisiana are more decent than those in French colonies and that while religion is rigorously enforced in Spain, there are few constraints in the colony Trénonay speaks more favorably than before about Louisiana, relates how it is changing, and becomes so optimistic about the colony's future that he says he would never leave if his family were there.</abstract>

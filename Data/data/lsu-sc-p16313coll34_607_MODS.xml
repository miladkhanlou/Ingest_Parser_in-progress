   <note type="biographical/historical"
         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, 'avocat en parlement,' Voiron, France, complaining that the writer's sister must be as lazy about corresponding as is their brother Lagoyette, whom the author believes to be preoccupied with gardening.  Trénonay relates his poor health, due in part to renal colic, and how he has handed over the management of his affairs (rendered worrisome by the conduct of slaves) to a 'worthy Englishman.'  He mentions the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 and how victims are still waiting for aid from the Spanish king.  Trénonay reports that Duplantier’s son Armand has left the plantation on which he was residing to establish himself on a newly acquired one situated nine leagues from the writer's home.  As in the January 3, 1787, letter, Trénonay affirms that Armand and children are in good health, but Armand's wife is not.  The writer announces that he will send the recipient and Lagoyette some plants care of 'Messieurs Bassae Alegre et Compagnie' in Le Havre.</abstract>

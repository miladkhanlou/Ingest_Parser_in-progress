   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Marc Antoine le Vaillant du Chastelet, Kingstown, St. Vincent, informs _________ of Antoine de Trénonay's expiration, attaching the extract concerning the September 10, 1780, death.  The author states that he had been sick with the same illness that killed Trénonay and that he and the deceased had been close comrades for 24 years.  He claims that he is still too weak to give a full account of Trénonay's affairs but briefly gives some indication of them.  On the back appears in another hand, 'Papers on the death of Monferra.'</abstract>

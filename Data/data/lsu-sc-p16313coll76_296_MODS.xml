He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana.De Rabars discusses the sociopolitical situation in France and mentions the advance of cholera in the Bordeaux area as well as the measures being taken to avoid the epidemic.  He reports that Auguste is now married to Louise Doussan, née Perrin.  De Rabars discusses his family life.  De Rabars mentions the drought in the Bordeaux area and asks if the vine slips he had sent Auguste's brother arrived.

   <note type="content" displayLabel="Summary">(Brun?), September 22, 1832, Charles de Rabars to Auguste Doussan in Baton Rouge, 'État de la Nlle. Orléans.'  De Rabars deplores the sociopolitical situation in France and mentions the advance of cholera in the Bordeaux area as well as the measures being taken to avoid the epidemic.  He says that Auguste is now married to Louise [née Perrin], and he hopes that things go well.  De Rabars complains about the trouble that his son has caused him, but the younger De Rabars has been home for a while and has returned to his old self.  De Rabars mentions the drought in the Bordeaux area.  He wants to know if the vine slips he had sent Auguste's brother arrived, and he will want to know if they survive in the future.  The writer says that if Dubroca [apparently in Louisiana] remembers him, then remember De Rabars to Dubroca and tell the latter about De Rabars' nephew Dunogué.

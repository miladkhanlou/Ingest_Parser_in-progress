   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Antoine Doussan to Auguste Doussan in Grasse.  The Doussans were an émigré French family who came to Louisiana in the wake of Napoleon's downfall.  The patriarch, Antoine, a medical doctor and former soldier under Napoleon, managed the family's cotton and sugar plantation in West Baton Rouge Parish as well as French-resident members' financial affairs in Louisiana. Auguste Doussan was the younger brother of Antoine Doussan.  He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. General Baron Joachim Ambert was a French military officer and nobleman with whom Antoine and Auguste Doussan had dealings. Antoine Doussan relates that 'Monsieur Valérien and Célestine' have arrived.  He describes Joachim and Julie Ambert's short stay and their apparent disdain for Louisiana. Antoine discusses business transactions and comments on the economic conditions of Louisiana and Mississippi. He also describes a storm that devastated Natchez, Mississippi.

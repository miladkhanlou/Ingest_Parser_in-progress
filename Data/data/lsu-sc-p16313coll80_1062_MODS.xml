   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$100 REWARD.  RANAWAY from the undersigned, at Opelousas, about the 1st of February, 1858, BECKY or BETSY, a griff girl, aged about 32 years, rather small size, heavy built, round face, and long hair, having on the lower jaw, a scar from a burn, and another larger one on the upper part of the arm. When she left she had a sore finger, supposed to be a felon. She speaks French and English. HELLEN, a fair complected mulatresse, about 28 years old, round face, middle size, on efinger near the thumb partly eat up by a felon. Hellen ranaway from Opelousas, about the 16th of February, 1858, was apprehended in Pointe Coupee about the 5th January, last, 1859, and brought back, from whence she started again about the 10th of the same month. It is almost certain that she is accompanied by some one and that she passes herself as free, as she done in Pointe Coupee. The above reward will be given to whoever will bring said two girls back to the undersigned or lodge them in one of the jails of this Sate so that he can get them again, or $50 for either of them.

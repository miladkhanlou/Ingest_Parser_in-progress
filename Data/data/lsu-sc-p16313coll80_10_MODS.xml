   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$10 Reward. I gave my negroman Aaron, a pass for a week, to work about Opelousas, as his wife was in the  neighborhood, dated 25th December last, since he which he has not returned. He is about 5 1/2 feet high, stout built, and has a swagger when walking. He rode off a dark bay creole horse; his clothes are green blanket coat, brown cloth coat, white linsey pantaloon, a beaver hat, small rim and low crown. His object is to force me  to sell him, so as to be near his wife. I will give the above reward to any person who will deliver him to me, at Prairie Plainsance, or put him in Jail so I get him again. JOHN NUGENT. St. Landry, 6 January 1854. 5--tf.</abstract>

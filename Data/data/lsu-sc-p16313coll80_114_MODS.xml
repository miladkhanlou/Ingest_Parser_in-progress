   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$50 REWARD--Ranaway from the subscriber on board the steamer Osceola, about 5 o'clock on the evening of the 1st inst. a bright Mulatto man named PRINCE, about 30 years of age, about 6 feet high, stout, heavy set, high forehead, speaks quick when spoken to. Had on when he left a dark summer coat, pale blue cotton pants, and an old fur cap. The above named boy was seen soon after he left, on St. Charles street, between Julia and St. Joseph streets, where his mother is now living. Any person who will arrest and secure him, so that I get him again, shall receive the above reward. All persons are warned not to harbor or employ him. Steamboat officers and ship masters are also warned not to carry him off. Any information addressed to me, at Nashville, Tenn., or Dr. C.H. DABBS, Munroe, La., or J.H.

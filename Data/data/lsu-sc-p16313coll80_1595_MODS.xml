   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$90 Reward! RAN-AWAY from the undersigned, on Sunday night the the 18th inst., THREE NEGRO MEN, as follows: SIMON, aged about 30 years, six feet high, and well made, front teeth out, carried himself tolerably well; color nearly black; can read and write, and will no doubt endeavor to pass by exhibiting a pass written by himself; or he may state that he is free. PEYTON, aged about 22 years, 5 feet 10 inches high; a little stoop-shouldered; legs short; color gray. LOUIS, aged about 22 years, about the same height as Peyton; color black; very cross-eyed. It is supposed that they will endeavor to reach New Orleans, and thence the upper country. $50 reward will be given for the apprehension and delivery of the boy Simon to me on my plantation, or for his safe lodgement in Jail; and $20 each for the arrest and delivery of either of the other boys. The boys had on when they left, blue roundabout coats; Simon had on a black silk or beaver hat. THEODORE JOHNSTON. Grosse Tête, Sept. 24th, 1853. sep24</abstract>

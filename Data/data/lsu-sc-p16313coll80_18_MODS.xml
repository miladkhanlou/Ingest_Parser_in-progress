   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$100 REWARD! Left my plantation on the night of the 3d inst., THREE NEGRO MEN, of the following names and descriptions: BOB, a bright mulatto, tall, spare made, weighing about one hundred and fifty or sixty pounds, and some 23 years old. CHARLES, of black complexion, weighs between one hundred and sixty and seventy pounds, stout built, about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, and about 25 years of age. GEORGE, dark complexion, large white eyes, slender built, weighs about one hundred and thirty or forty pounds, and about 23 years old. I purchased these boys last November from a man named McGennis, of the State of Missouri. I will pay the above reward for the said boys if delivered on my plantation, or if lodged in any jail so I can get them, or for any information that will lead to their recovery. E. B. COTTON. Trinity, Catahoula parish, La., June, 1860. N. B. Said boys took with them three shot guns-two double and one single. It is suppsed they were decoyed off by some white man, who may, perhaps, be travelling through the country with them as his property. 3t-*</abstract>

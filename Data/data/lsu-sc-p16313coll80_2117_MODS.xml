   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Runaway.---$25 Reward. I WILL PAY the above reward and all reasonable expenses, if delivered to me, for my negro man ISOM, or I will pay $100 (one hundred dollars,) for evidence that would lead to the conviction of any party or parties that may have been tampering with the said boy. Isom is black, about 45 years old, rather spare built and carries himself very erect. He generally wears a light beard on the chin with (perhaps) a small moustache, and has a good open countenance. He left my plantation in the this parish on the night of the 4th inst., and it is presumed he had no other apparel than that worn through the day, viz: pantaloons and shirt of white cotton osnaburg, as he left the cotton field when work for the day was suspended. Address me at Alexandria, La., or if the boy should be placed in jail in New Orleans, apply to Messrs. West, Renshaw &amp; Cammack, there. ""Omega Plantation,"" Rapides, La. September 25th, 1860.

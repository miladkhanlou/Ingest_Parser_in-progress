   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">STOLEN, A Negro and Mule. ON Saturday night the 9th instant from the undersigned, a negro man of black complesion, 22 years old, weighs about 150 lbs., 5 feet nine inches high, likely and intelligent when spoken to, holds his head to one side and looks you straight in the face; the milye is mouse color, a mare, 8 years old 13 1/2 hands high, branded indistinctly on the left shoulder with the letter D.  There were two men seen with the negro at my place six miles east of Minden, on the road to Monroe, riding a black and roan horse, and I believe they took him and the mule off; he had the pants he had worked in all the week, but had on a clean shirt, but no coat.  For the property and the thieves I will pay a reward of one thousand dollars if delievered at my house; or if lodged in any jail where I can get them, eight hundred dollars, or five hundred dollars for the negro and mule.

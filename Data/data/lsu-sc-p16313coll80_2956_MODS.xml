   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$125 Reward. THE undersigned has good reasons to believe that a man by the name of Elijah Horn has decoyed away or stolen her negro boy Monore. Said negro left my residence, in Columbia county, Ark., on Sunday, 29th October last, and I will pay a reward of $25 for his apprehension and delivery to me, or on his being safely lodged in jail so that I can get him; and I will give $100 for the arrest of Horn and sufficient evidence to convict him of the theft. The negro boy, Monroe, is a dark mulatto, about 5 feet 5 inches high, heavy set, square shoulders, and a down look when spoken to; is about 20 years of age, was born in Kentucky, and brought to Arkansas 8 years ago. Horn is of fair complexion, sandy hair a little inclined to redish color, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, inclined to corpulency, is of frank and open countenance. He reports himself as belonging to Kentucky; but this is uncertain, as from circumstances recently developed, it is believed that he is connected with a clan of thieves. The direction he has taken is unknown. Address, ELIZABETH A. BUCKNER, Mount Holly, Arkansas, or JOHN A. TOOKE, Ringgold, Bienville parish, La. nov 22-4t*</abstract>

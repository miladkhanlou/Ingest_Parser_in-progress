   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Look Out for the Runaways! RANAWAY from the subscriber's plantation, near Black Jack, DeSoto parish, on Sunday last, the negro boys NELSON and JOSEPSH Nelson is a light colored negro, about 18 years of age, 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high, and well built. Joseph is of black complexion, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches in height, 20 years of age; he has a downcast look, speak very slowly and occastonally stammers when confused or hurried; he has a whip-mark near one of his eyes. Had on when he left a blue coat and high crowned white hat, but will undoubtedly, together with Nelson, change his apparel. It is probably that these negros will attempt to reach Memphis, Tenn., and officers of steamboats and all others are cautioned not to harbor or employ them under the penalties of the law. I will pay a liberal reward to any one who will deliver said boys to me, or place them in any jail so that I can get them again. WM. PENNYWELL. Black Jack, DeSoto parish, March 21, 1855 2m*</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Runaway FROM the subscriber a few days ago, the negro man Wash or Washington. He is very likely, about 30 years old, a bright mulatto, has the apprearance of a mongrel Mexican, 5 feet 9 or 10 inches in height, and wears whiskers under his chin. He formerly belonged to Mr. C. W. Gibson, and is well known in Shreveport, where he was seen on Sunday evening last, and is probably lurking about town. All persons are cautioned against harboring said boy under the penalty of the law. A liberal reward will be paid for his apprehension and elivery to me, or detention in jail so that I can get him again. T. M. GILMER july 28</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$100 Reward. I WILL give the above reward for the delivery to me of my negro man ABRAM, who ran away from my plantation on Bayou De Sieard, 8 miles east of Monroe, about the 1st of October 1859. Abram is of dark complexion, about 6 feet 4 or 6 inches high, and about 35 years of age. He has some scars on his breast, no other marks recollected. He is very quick spoken, and is inclined to be stoop-shouldered. He may say that he belongs to some person in Caldwell parish, where he formerly lived. He has a wife at Mr. Overton Ross', near Columbia, La., in which vicinity he has been seen since he left. I will give $80 for his confinement in any jail in the State, or $100 if delivered to me. JAMES M. FRANTOM. Monroe, La., May 21st 1860. 4t-$5*</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD. -- RAN away on the morning of July 31st, from No. 156 Gravier street, the bright mulatto girl named MARY SNEAD, well known in the First and Second Districts, and by the police and cabmen generally. Said girl has been in litigation for some time back between Abrams and Bear. Has straight hair, cut ahout half way down here neck ; is of dissolute habits, and would probably be found hanging around some quateroon houses in the rear of the city. The above reward will be paid for the delivery of the girl at my office, or in any jail so that I can get her. One hundred dollars will be paid for the conviction of any white many who may have harbored or induced said slave to abscond, as I believe some white person has induced her to go away and still conceals her.

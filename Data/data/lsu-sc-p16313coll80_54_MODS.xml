   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$200 Reward! Disappeared from the plantation of the subscribers, on the morning of the 23d of February, the mulatto boy ""STANFORD BROWN,"" a Cooper by trade. He is about 35 years old, 5 feet 9 inches high, wears thin black whiskers on the lower part of his face, cheeks sunken and face lean, and has a hard look; has been cupped on the back of the neck, which may have left a scar; has several old flat scars on his back, such as might arise from a boil or a bruise; has broad shoulders, but is slnder below the hips. He can read and write, is polite in his manners, lisps slightly, generally dresses well, and is handy as a carpenter and shoemaker. It is supposed to that the above described slave has been enticed off by some white person, and may be concealed on board some boat or vessel. The above reward will be paid to any person who shall lodge said slave, and any person who may have induced him to leave, in any jail in this State; or $100 will be given for the delivery of said slave in any such jail, and $100 for such information as shall lead to the conviction of any person who may have abducted him. Captains of vessels and steamboats, and all other persons, are cautioned against harboring said slave, as the law will be strictly enforced against all such offenders. DARBY BROTHERS. Parish of St. Mary, March 3, 1853. tf</abstract>

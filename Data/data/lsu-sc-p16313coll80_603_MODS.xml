   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">RANAWAY From the plantation of the undersigned, in West Baton Rouge, about the 14th of AUGUST last, the negro man SAM, aged about 25 years, of black complexion, very likely, and when spoken to looks wild; he is about five feet eleven inches high. I purchased him of Henry A. Castle on the 5th of April 1859, and by him bought of Col. John R. White, of St. Louis, Mo. A reasonable reward will be given for his delivery to me, or committed in any jail so that I may get him. JOHN BUHLER. [oct 13-ts]</abstract>

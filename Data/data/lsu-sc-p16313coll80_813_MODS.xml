RANAWAY from the plantation of the subscriber, in the Parish of Natchitoches, on the night of the 26th May, a negro-boy named WILLIAM ; dark mulatto, aged about 35 years, stout built, bow-legged, and 5 feet 6 inches in height. He has a scar on the first knuckle of the fore-finger of the right hand, caused by a cut with a spade, the wound of which was not cured at the time he ran off.

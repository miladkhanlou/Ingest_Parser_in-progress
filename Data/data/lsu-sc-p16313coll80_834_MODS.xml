   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">RUNAWAY NEGRO! $150 REWARD!! RANAWAY from the plantation of the undersigned, below Pattersonville, on the 28th of June last, a mulatto boy named CARLOS. He is aged about 22 years, is 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high, and speaks both the English and French languages, but the later with more facility. He looks very much like an Indian, his fram, his straight black hair, his reddish complexion, and his very carriage bespeaking that origin. The above reward will be given to whoever will take him to the undersigned, or lodge him safely in one of the jails of this State, and inform the owners of his arrest. Captains of steamboats or other crafts are requested to notice the above. G.A. BRIANT &amp; BROTHER. Pattersonville, La., Dec. 4th, 1858. -- 2t.

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">LOOK AT THIS : $500 REWARD! RUNAWAY or was taken away from the plantation of the subscriber, on the 15th inst., the negro-man HAMMOCK, aged about 23 years, about 6 feet 1 inch in height, high cheek bones, rather sharp featured, quick spoken, long legged and walks very much like an Indian. --Had on when he left a black cotton velvet coat. --A carpenter and blacksmith by trade --Can read and write, and is no doubt in possession of a forged pass. I have good reason to suspect that he is in the company of a white man whose name is unknown to me, as I saw a suspicious character prowling around my plantation on the day of the night on which he absconded. As I did not get nearer to the white man than fifty feet, I am unable to give a correct description of him further than to say that he is about 5 feet 8 inches in height, stoop shouldered, very heavy black whiskers which indeed might have been false, high cheek bones and had all the appearance of a foreigner. I will give the above reward for the apprehension of the white man together with such testimony as may insure his conviction, and for the negro, all legal charges for his apprehension and incarceration in any jail either within the State or out of it. George Hill. Parish of St. Landry, June 25th, 1859.

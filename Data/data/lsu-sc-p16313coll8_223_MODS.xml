   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Francis Palms, New Orleans, writes to Henrietta Lauzin, West Baton Rouge.  He informs her that he may not remain in Louisiana for another year and comments on their relationship.  In comparing their relationship to a journey, he states 'We have travelled together, through the year almost too close, with emotions, I trust, of mutual sympathy for the welfare of each other.'  Before closing, he states 'We have reached another stopping place, without fear or accident, and in preparing for a new start, permit me to claim you as a fellow traveller...'.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Frank Babin, Cotton Press Prison, New Orleans, writes to Henrietta Lauzin.  He begins in a joking manner, stating 'How do you like the name of our magnificent and most secluded- quiet and safe hotel?'  He  then informs her that he will buy Francis Palms' pipe, but states 'I do not like to trust it to the person Frank requested me to- as I am afraid he will make use of it- for his own special benefit.' Additionally, he comments on his living conditions stating, 'Our quarters are pretty good- but too much crowded.  There is a good deal of sickness.'  Before closing he states that he has enclosed a ring and asks Henrietta to deliver it to Miss Marie.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Alex R. Hunstock, Camp Buckner, Kentucky, writes to Henrietta Lauzin, Baton Rouge.  He informs her that his regiment has moved 'three or four times' since he had last written, and describes an encounter with the enemy while en route to their current location.  He then provides details of the fatalities suffered during the conflict and remarks on their success stating 'I think this war will soon be at an end for from all appearances we cannot get a chance to have a fight as the Yankees are retreating every day'.</abstract>

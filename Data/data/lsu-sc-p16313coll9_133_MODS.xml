   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female adult, Hua Moo-Lan of China, composition head on hard board body, composition forearms, molded and painted features, dress decorated with feather, metallic trimming, big pink fabric flower on upper front body, very elaborate hair-dress, two wings on shoulders, standing on yellow-wooden plate, all, hand and machine-made. Accompanying information describes that Hua Moo-Lan, was a gi.rl and also a well known soldier during the 6th century when China was divided into many states or small nations. During that period all states were at war with one another. Moo-Lan's father, an officer of the Han State, was supposed to lead an army to defend the country, however, he was old and had no sons except the daughter Moo-Lan, therefore, Moo-Lan, who loved her father dearly, disguised herself as a man, to take her father's place as an officer, and to lead the country to fight the enemies. She fought side by side for many years with her fellow soldiers and officers but none had discovered that she was a girl except to respect her as a brave soldier and an able general. Finally her army defeated the enemies. She became the nation's great hero and then her father announced that she was a young lady, not a man, therefore, the Ruler of Han State paid special respect to her and proclaimed her as a most filial piety daughter of the nation (This description was written by a Chinese woman).</abstract>

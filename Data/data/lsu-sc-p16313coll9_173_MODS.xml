   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female, composition socket head on body, lower arms, lower limbs, cloth upper arms and upper limbs, black human hair, straight short wig has bang on front, glass eyes, closed mouth, no shoes, crane printed red kimono with red  brocaded obi, red tie-dyed silk underneath the kimono sleeves, barefoot, doll, body, and dress are made by hand, broken neck. For thousands of years, a doll festival has been held on the third day of March. The festival lasts for three days. To the people of Japan, the doll festivals are expressionsof the ideal of Japanese womanhood--to be a good and true wife, a wise and loving mother. It was a happy inspiration on the part of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America to organize a movement to send American dolls as representatives to the doll festival of Japan in 1927. Eleven hundred dolls sailed from San Francisco to Japan. Forty-eight dolls were sent to the Imperial Museum representing the forty-eight states. Because of the arrival of the friendship dolls the Japanese Children's Friendship Association was organized. After receiving the many dolls sent to them by the united States, the Japanese Children's Friendship Association sent one thousand dolls to the children of the United States. This doll was one of these dolls. (Ref. 3)""</abstract>

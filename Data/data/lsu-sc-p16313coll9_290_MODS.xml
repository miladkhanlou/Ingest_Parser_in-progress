   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female adult, 20cm, Osage Indian doll, bisque shoulder head on cloth body, bisque forearms and lower limbs, molded and painted dark skin color and features, jointed at shoulder and hips, long human hair breaded with beads, bead decorated head-band, brown animal skin dress has fringe on sleeves and hem, bead necklace, left foot wears moccasin decorated with beads. Accompanying information describes that imitating the white man's customs in many ways, North American Indians soon began to make dolls with which their children also might play. The Indians of the plains made doll clothes of skins and decorated them with fringe and beads. In making the costumes, the Indians tried to be as realistic as possible. These are valuable records of early Indian costumes. Doll body is hand-made. Costume is machinemade. The Indians of the plains made doll clothes of skins and decorated them with fringe and beads.

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female adult, China shoulder head on cloth body, china forearms and lower limbs with molded boots, molded and painted features and hair, blonde, jointed at shoulders and hips, lace trimmed white linen underwear, lace trimmed white linen under-skirt, horizontal machine tucks, brown and black stripped dress, cuffs and neckline lace trimmed, front skirt has three layers, tucked vertically, back skirt has two layers, tucked to hip area golden brown and cross pin, all, machine and hand-made. Accompanying information describes that the doll is dressed in an infare dress--or the second day dress of the bride. Infare, an old English word meaning second day. The brides parents gave a big dinner for the bride the day she was married. On the second day, the groom's parents gave a big dinner which was called the infare dinner. The bride, the bride's mother and the groom's mother all had new dresses for the dinner called Infare Dresses. The material of this dress was used for an infare dress. The lace on the underwear is old. Chaucer uses the word infare in a poem.</abstract>

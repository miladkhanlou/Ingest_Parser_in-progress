Edward N. Marsh Civil War Letter Baton Rouge December 18th 1862

Dear Brother and Sister it is with great pleasure I now seat myself to write you a few lines to let you know that I am pretty well and hope that these few lines will find you the same. We left New Orleans the 16th for this place and sailed up the river with our little expedition. I don't know how many thousand there is here. They have not all go here yet. The Iron Clad Esex [Essex] came up ahead and 4 or 5 other gun Boats followed her. We got here at 9 o'clock in the morn and they fired 13 shots into the City and they sent a flag down to the Boat and left as soon as possible and then we sent a boat with some men to the Capital of the place and put up the flag of our union and then the troops began to land and the Confederates left the place. As soon as possible we came up into the City and pitched our tent and we went into the houses and brought out chairs and books and every thing that we could get that we could use. I got this paper out of an account book. There was a report today our men had drove the Rebels out of Vicksburg and that they were coming down this way. There was twenty thousand of them above here about 14 miles1. We have to sleep with cartridges [cartridge] boxes and belts on and lay on our guns and have them loaded with 4 rounds and cartridges in our boxes and we keep out pickets now.... The inhabitants have most all left the place when we fired into the City. They killed two Boys. They were helping the Rebels to get their cannons away from here.... There was 50 Negroes ran from their master and came here for protection today. 19th There was 32 more come today with their Budgets(?) with them. They say that they have not had any shoes for one year and they are barefooted almost. Their clothes are awful ragged. The inhabitants are starving. They cannot get salt hardly. It is 75 cents a lb and a girl told me yesterday that her Master was dead and she hired her time of her Mistress. She pays her three dollars a week for time. She said she had to work tremendous hard to live. Flour is forty dollars a barrel in United States money and 80 dollars in Confederate money....We expect an attack any time. (I think) we shall have a hard fight here or at that fort above here about 15 miles before long. This city looks hard. There is a great many houses Burnt to the ground.

Eliza Magruder Diary [January] 19th, [1846] Rained incessantly all day, the wind blowing pretty fresh most of the time from N.E. which prevented Uncle Dunbar from going to the Plains to survey. I read a half hour this evening, with that exception, I knit all day. 20th Rained early this morning, about eight o clock the wind got round to S.W. and there was every appearance of its clearing up, but in a few hours it clouded up again it has been misting all the afternoon. Uncle Dunbar has been writing in the Office nearly all day, Mr. Archer dined here, he has just recovered from an attack of ague and fever, Mr. Johnston rode up to the gate this afternoon and told Uncle Dunbar of his carriage horses having been stolen out of the stable last Sunday night, and of his haveing found them in Natchez, the next day. Aunt Olivia had Alfred and Jim setting out evergreens in the yard this morning. I wrote two letters this morning one to Lucy the other to Lloyd, and this evening knit a pair of dolls socks. Cousin Susan is still with us and recruiting(?). 21st Cloud this morning, cleared about noon. Uncle Dunbar went to the Plains to survey, did not return tonight. Aunt Olivia has been out a good deal to day seeing to the setting out of evergreens in the yard, had the rose hedge at the end of the store room cut up. She read four homilies to Cousin Susan and I to night. I mended a coat for Uncle Dunbar to day and commenced a coarse mit to night for one of the negro men. 22nd A little cloudy and very cold. Uncle Dunbar not yet returned from the Plains. Aunt Olivia had a Loriamunda hedge set in the place of the rose hedge, was out having work done on the back yar when Mr. Hall came, who dined here today. I have read and knit all day--Aunt July spun me some knitting cotton, and Aunt Olivia doubled it tonight. Note from the curator: Transcription reflects spelling as it appears in the original.

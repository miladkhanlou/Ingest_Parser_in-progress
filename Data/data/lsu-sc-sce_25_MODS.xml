   <abstract displayLabel="Description">France et Espagne (1850) is about the Revolution of 1768, but in it Canonge was less concerned with following history than he was with creating a dramatic effect.  He introduced romantic characters to heighten the drama. The play was based on the novel Louisiana, written by Garreau and published in La Revue Louisianaise in 1845.</abstract>
   <note type="content">Born in Louisiana to French parents, Louis Placide Canonge (1822-1893) exemplifies the continuing tradition of Louisiana literature written in French. As a young man, Canonge frequently visited Paris, where he developed a deep love for the arts and literature, as well as a taste for being culturally au courant. According to the Cambridge History of English and American Literature, he was the best dramatist produced by Louisiana.... He was a director of opera and a journalist of some note; he edited La Lorgnette, L'Entracte, Courrier, L'Impartial, Le Courrier Fran√ßais, Le Sud, La Renaissance, L'Epoque, and L'Abeille, the last-named, founded in 1827, being the first French daily newspaper published in the United States. His plays followed the French romantic tradition, and were extremely popular because of their gaiety and enthusiasm.</note>

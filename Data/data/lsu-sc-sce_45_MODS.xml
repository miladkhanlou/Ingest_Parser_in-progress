   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Duplantier was born in Voiron, France, in 1753.  He served as General Lafayette's aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War and in 1782 came to Louisiana to assist his maternal uncle, Claude Trenonay, with his plantation in Pointe Coupee.  Through his marriage to Constance Rochon, he acquired Magnolia Mound Plantation, located on Nicholson Drive.  In this letter to his brother living in France during the French Revolution, Duplantier relates settling the estate of his uncle, the discovery of a planned slave insurrection in Pointe Coupe√© Parish and the unease it has caused because of the fresh memory of the slave revolt in Saint Domingue (now Haiti), and his desire to send his children to America or France for an education because of the lack of opportunity in Louisiana  His letter also illustrates the difficulty Louisiana colonists had in maintaining communications with their families in France.</abstract>

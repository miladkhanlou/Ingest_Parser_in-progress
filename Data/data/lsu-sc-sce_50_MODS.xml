Guillaume-Michel Perrault Letter New Orleans, this 30th of April, 1788 Mrs. Widow Perrault, at Quebec in Canada Madam and Dear Sister: I inform you with pleasure of the receipt of your two kind letters of July 3 and November 8 last. They have given me still more pleasure as they confirm to me the continuation of your good health and that of the whole family, which I love as I love you and whom I embrace from the bottom of my heart. Dear sister, while you notify me in your last letter of the receipt of my letter of March 1, to which I am still referring, I cannot but be very moved by the proof you give me of looking forward to the moment of my arrival in your midst. Dear sister, you should not doubt the reciprocity of the good wishes that I have constantly formed to be able to join you, but a number of obstacles seem to arrive to make this impossible until this moment. Dear sister, we have just suffered most cruelly from all that might have happened through the general fire (excepting only a few houses) of our city, which was reduced to ashes in less than two hours by flames carried by the wind to the four corners of this unfortunate city. In this deadly desolation, I had only the time to save myself from my house and to have poor Mrs. [Demieux ?] taken from her bed there (stricken as she was for the past six months with a gangrenous and deadly dysentery), which despicable acts and my embarrassment at being obliged to put this dear niece in the middle of a field during a most ghastly night without covering or mattress for her or shelter determined my taking her to the German Parish, to one of the settlers who is a friend, and it is there that in spite of all possible care, God put an end to the great pain and suffering of this dear niece for whom I cannot but feel the deepest sorrow. After my last attentions to her, I returned to this deserted city to come to the aid of poor Laveau, the most friendly but also the most unfortunate man in this general disaster, from which he has not succeeded in saving even a garment. You can judge how badly I felt when I saw him, his wife, and three children all by themselves, forced to stay in a thatch roof while waiting for a small house (which I am having built for them and which I will let them use freely) to be finished so that they may\n\nlodge there. In this general misfortune, dear sister, I have lost 10,000 piastres1 consisting of three houses and a small shop where there were lots of goods, nice furniture, and all kinds of useful articles, as well as about three thousand piastres in paper money that I absentmindedly had put in a corner of my armoire, believing that I had placed them safely in a small money box where I kept my other important papers and that I only hurriedly had been able to take with me. This loss of ten thousand piastres I just suffered was, dear sister, all the profits (after expenses) that my toil and work had acquired for me since my arrival in this colony, together with the small capital you know about, which I had brought with me and which remains mine, as I almost always had them invested in annuities well secured by good land and notes endorsed by credible people. This is my position concerning what I have left. Moreover, I remain the guardian and caretaker of the two children of the poor deceased, the ones remaining of the five she had at the time of her troubles with her husband, who is a bandit and whom I had thrown out of my place six years ago, all this taken together with having to observe the sad situation of Laveau and his family, left with no other resources but his income from his work, which will never again cover his losses....

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In 1856 Lloyd's Steamboat Directory and Disasters on the Western Waters details more than a hundred steamboat disasters, including explosions, collisions, sinkings, and capsizes.  The illustration showing the explosion of the steamship Louisiana docked in New Orleans is shown.</abstract>
   <note type="content">Early European explorers faced many challenges, including unfamiliar and sometimes dangerous flora and fauna, as well as the hostility of the human inhabitants whose homelands they sought to take for themselves.  Under French government policy, the native population was soon decimated by systematic extermination and disease.  Later settlers found diseases such as yellow fever and typhoid a threat during the summer months. Along with the multitude of natural hazards that new populations faced, sometimes transportation was a source of danger in itself.</note>

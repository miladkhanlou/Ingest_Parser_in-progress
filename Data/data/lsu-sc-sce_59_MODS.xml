   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Huey P. Long was elected governor of Louisiana in 1928.  Two years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate.  He continued to influence the state through his chosen successor, O, K. Allen.  In 1934, Longâ€™s own presidential ambitions and his more radical social platform led him to break with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and form an alternative political organization, the Share-Our-Wealth Society.  Through the society, he advocated redistributing wealth through sharply graduated income and inheritance taxes. He found a ready and sympathetic audience for his ideas in Depression-era Americans.  Long effectively used radio to distribute his populist message.  This transcript is from a 1935 broadcast by Long. He was assassinated the same year.</abstract>

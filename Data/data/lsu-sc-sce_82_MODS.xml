   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The elaborately engraved title page is fascinating for its symbolism.  The top section is dominated by a triangle symbolizing the Holy Trinity, with nine angelic choirs singing a canon on the words "Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus" (holy, holy, holy). The middle section contains secular symbolism: a female figure seated on a globe holds the lyre of Apollo and the panpipes of Marsyas, musical rivals who were judged by the Muses. 

The lowest part of the picture shows blacksmiths in a cave: the sound of blacksmiths hammering led the Greek philosopher Pythagoras to important conclusions about musical pitch.  Pythagoras points to the blacksmiths and holds an illustration of his theorem, also using triangles, and hence referring obliquely once again to the Trinity at the top of the picture.</abstract>
   <note type="content">A Jesuit polymath, Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) published more than 30 books on subjects ranging from China to Egypt to music.  Musurgia is his most influential work and was a source for almost every later German music theorist until well into the 18th century.  It is still considered essential to an understanding of 17th-century music and music theory.</note>

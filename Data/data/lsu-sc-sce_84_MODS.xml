   <abstract displayLabel="Description">James Taylor Tanner was born in Homer, New York, on March 6, 1914. He attended Cornell University and worked under Arthur A. Allen throughout the course of his graduate study. Tanner's master's thesis was titled "Sound Recording for a Natural History Museum." His Ph.D. dissertation, "Life History and Ecology of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker," was based on 21 months of field studies in the Singer tract in northeastern Louisiana, the last refuge for this nearly extinct species. In 1942 the National Audubon Society published Tanner's dissertation as "Research report number 1: The Ivory-billed Woodpecker."  The images presented here were taken by Tanner while on field study expeditions in Louisiana during the years 1935 to 1940.</abstract>

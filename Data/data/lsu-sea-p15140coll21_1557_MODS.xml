The vegetation is winegrass (Spartina patens)" Marshes broken to this extent generally remain unproductive for long periods unless artificially drained.  This particular area was eaten-out in 1939,"(Photo taken 1942), and revegetated during the drought of July, August, and September 1947.  It is possible that under excellent management, this area will carry a normal 'rat population by 1950-51.</abstract>

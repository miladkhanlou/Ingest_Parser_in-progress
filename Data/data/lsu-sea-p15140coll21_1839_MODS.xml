   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Seeing the massive disorder in Major General Gibbs' column, Major General Pakenham rode forward.  While attempting to rally his troops and get the stalled attack underway, Pakenham was mortally wounded a few yards from this site.' Major General Keane, commanding the British near the river; sent the 93rd Highlanders to lead a second assault.  They crossed the field, moving towards Gibbs' troops on the British right.  This regiment was decimated with grapeshot and mustket fire.  A few men reached the rampart, but found no fascines or ladders or help.  They were quickly killed or captured.  When their commander, Colonel Dale, was killed, the advance of the 93rd failed and the remaining troops retreated in disarray.  Their withdrawal threw the rest of the British army into confusion and the men loss all sense of formation, retreating in terror and panic.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">As we stood watching this Plaquemines fisherman sitting on the deck of his own trawler tied up on the Cazezu Canal near Buras, mending a net and minding his own business, his face swarthy from the combination of sun and a Latin heritage, we realized we were looking at a typical independent inhabitant of this parish.  He and the thousands of others who comprise the bulk of the census of this rich river-land, may not be Emily Posted or hep to the Book-of-the-Month Club, but they will continue to wrest a comfortable living from the waters and soil of their parish long after the students of psychology and philosophy have become public charges.</abstract>

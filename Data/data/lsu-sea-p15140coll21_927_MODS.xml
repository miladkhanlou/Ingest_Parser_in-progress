   <abstract displayLabel="Description">BEFORE AND AFTER SCENES AT GRAND PASS OYSTER LABORATORY   To the right is a view of the Oyster Laboratory of the Wild Life and Fisheries Department located at the north-west boundary of Grand Pass.  Experimental tanks and cistern are seen in the foreground.  The biological laboratory within the building was modernly equipped." This view shows what was left of the Oyster Laboratory following the hurricane which swept the Gulf Coast last September.  Not even a piece of lumber was left and everything was completely destroyed.  Total damage to building and laboratory equipment is estimated at $30,000.  Plans are underway to rebuild the laboratory as soon as practical.</abstract>

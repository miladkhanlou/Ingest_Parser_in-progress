  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Barker recounts his childhood in Lockport, La., which included working and playing with other kids at the Clotilda Plantation.  Barker discusses the sugarcane business, then and now, throughout the interview.  He briefly discusses his education, which included an agricultural engineering degree from Louisiana State University, and his time in the armed forces during World War II at Camp Claiborne, Guadalcanal, and Japan.  He discusses his concept of home and the role of Catholicism in his life.  He and his wife (Aline) and niece (Dee Dee Gaubert) discuss the changes in Bayou Lafourche's commerce with the advent of the oil industry and topography due to erosion.  Aline discusses her family's background and the role of French in her life.  They discuss Valentine Sugar, both the processing of sugarcane and the development of paper products.</abstract>

He spent his first years in a house on Carrollton Avenue, across the street from the Notre Dame Seminary.  His father, a sugar trader, moved the family to the Clotilda Plantation, outside Lockport, La.  Barker attended St. Stanislaus High School and Louisiana State University, where he studied agricultural engineering, and served in the U.S. Army during World War II, serving in the Pacific Theater.  He married Aline Herbert of Larose and the couple had six children and numerous grandchildren.  He is a fourth-generation sugarcane farmer and his professional career included work with Valentine Sugars (where Aline also worked), Bollinger Shipyards, and A.E. Staley.  Barker lived at Clotilda Plantation until his death in 2012.</note>

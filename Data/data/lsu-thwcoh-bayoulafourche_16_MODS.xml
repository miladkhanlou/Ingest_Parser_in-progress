  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Loyman Melancon discusses his childhood as the youngest of five in rural Cut Off, Louisiana, in the 1930s and 1940s, including learning to swim, playing sports, childhood games, trapping with his father, and spending time with his widowed grandmother.  After high school he married and worked in the oil fields, where he advanced through a number of roles, until his father-in-law asked him to join his oyster business.  Melancon speaks at length about oystering, including salinity requirements, leasing and maintenance of oyster beds, dredging fresh oysters, steam plants, canning, predators, and the impact of the 2010 oil spill.  He also discusses the role of French in his upbringing and his current efforts to preserve the language.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Loyman Melancon was born and raised in Cut Off, Louisiana, the youngest of five siblings.  He grew up in a rural environment, relied on the bayou for transportation, and played sports at Cut Off High School (including on the 1953 six-man football team, which won the state championship).  He married Mamie Eymard after secondary school; the couple had five children.  Melancon worked in the oil industry until his father-in-law asked him to join his oystering business, which included a fleet of four ships.  Melancon joined, and eventually took over, the business, from which he retired in 1985.  In his retirement he travels and participates in groups to preserve Cajun French.</note>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Lefort discusses her childhood on the bayou, including attending a two-room schoolhouse, attending church, trapping with her father, and working at a shrimp shed during World War II.  She recalls meeting her husband in a local movie theater, and discusses her family's genealogical roots.  She tells how she acquired her current residence, which is a converted boarding house for Bayou Lafourche educators, and discusses the motivations and practices she uses in her painting.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Ophelia Lefort was born in the late 1920s in Galliano, Louisiana, and raised in the 1930s.  She attended Cut Off High School in the 1940s, and worked at a shrimp shed.  Her first boyfriend was Pershing Lefort (circa 1924-2003), whom she met at the Galliano movie theater; they were engaged before World War II, and married after the war.  The Leforts moved to Lafayette for her husband's education, then returned to Bayou Lafourche, where they raised four children and he worked in the oil industry.  After the youngest of their children was in school, Lefort became a middle school secretary, and began painting in 1985.  Lefort is an accomplished amateur painter, depicting scenes of bayou life on unusual surfaces (oyster shells, cypress shingles, etc.).  She and her late husband bought and preserved a former teacher boarding house in Larose, Louisiana, where she still resides.</note>

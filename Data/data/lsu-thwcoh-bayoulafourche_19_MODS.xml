  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Robichaux discusses his childhood in Thibodaux, including his semi-rural home life (animals in the backyard), places to eat in Thibodaux (including a discussion of home cooking), and the group of boys he termed the "Hinkety-dinkety Club." He discusses his musical and parochial education, and how it led to his career as a chaplain's assistant in the Air Force (stationed in Okinawa, Japan), and eventually to playing organ at St. Joseph Co-Cathedral in Thibodaux. Robichaux reflects on Thibodaux's early days (even before he was born, ca. 1900 through the 1940s), and how the damming of Bayou Lafourche at Donaldsonville (1904) has changed the culture of the bayou. Robichaux briefly discusses the sugarcane industry (the family was involved), and how World War II, technology, and television changed the culture of Thibodaux from "the simple life." He discusses the construction, growth, and restoration of St. Joseph Co-Cathedral, and also enumerates the events (Masses, weddings, funerals) at which he has played the organ.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">R. Gibbens Robichaux was born in 1930 in Thibodaux, Louisiana, son of Alfred G. Robichaux, Sr. and Sara Day Gibbens Robichaux. He had one brother, Alfred G. Robichaux, Jr. (ca. 1928-2012) and was raised in Thibodaux, growing up in a house across the street from his grandparents (Eugene Godfrey Robichaux and Brigeitte Emma Thibodaux Robichaux) and a few blocks from Bayou Lafourche. He attended parochial school; first Mt. Carmel Convent Academy (now the Carmel Inn), and then Brothers of the Sacred Heart School, from which he graduated at sixteen. He met his future wife, Joann, as a teenager. He attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama (his father is also an alumnus); both he and his dad played piano and had bands in college. Robichaux enlisted in the US Air Force and was stationed for twenty-five months in Okinawa, Japan, where he was a chaplain's assistant and learned to play the organ. He returned to the States, married his wife, and was stationed in Marietta, Georgia. After he returned to Thibodaux he taught briefly (seventh grade), then worked for the welfare office, before becoming the organist of St. Joseph Co-Cathedral in Thibodaux, where he worked for twenty years. He is still involved in the church and music communities in his retirement. He has written a number of children's books, wrote a regular column for the Thibodaux Chamber of Commerce newsletter, and has released three CDs of music.</note>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Guidry discusses his family's genealogy and his interest in Cajun genealogy and historical research in general.  He tells about his education to the seventh grade, which included corporal punishment, and his Catholic upbringing.  His mother worked in a shrimp factory and his father was a fisherman.  His large family was somewhat isolated from the poverty of the depression because they grew so much of their own food and his mother was very resourceful.  Guidry discusses shrimping as a teenager, trapping, and oystering.  He recounts childhood games and beginning to fish at 13.  He recalls a childhood vacation to Barataria Bay, which included harvesting bigorneaux (saltwater snails), a visit to Fort Livingston, and encountering an alligator.  He recalls working on the water during World War II and seeing submarines and other wartime activity.  Guidry also discusses the role of the church in the community (history and physical construction) and in his current life.</abstract>

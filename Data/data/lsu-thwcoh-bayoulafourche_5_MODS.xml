  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Robichaux discusses her upbringing in a Houma community just outside of Golden Meadow, Louisiana, and the history of the contentious relationship between the Houma and the white communities of south Louisiana.  The family grew much of its own food, and her father always made sure the family was well fed, even during economically challenging times.  Robichaux discusses the changes in Bayou Lafourche, including the saltwater erosion and the rise in industry in formerly residential communities.  She discusses her grandfather's (Ernest Dardar, a traiteur) role in the community, and recounts the gathering spaces for the family and community, which included the Catholic chapel, her father's boat, and her parents' house.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Brenda Dardar Robichaux was born and raised in a Houma Indian community just south of the corporation limits of Golden Meadow, Louisiana.  Her grandfather, Ernest Dardar, was a traiteur, or healer, and her father was a fisherman.  The youngest child in her family, she was among the first Indian students to integrate Bayou Lafourche public schools, and she worked for the parish school district early in her career.  She served as the Principal Chief of the United Houma Nation (1997-2010), and is an outspoken advocate for minority rights.  She has also served on numerous boards (Second Harvest, Inter-Tribal Council of Louisiana, National Indian Education Association, Rockefeller Philanthropy Gulf Coast Ecological Health and Community Renewal Fund Advisory Group, New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage) and has won many awards for her service from local and national organizations (Times Picayune, Ms. Foundation, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, United Houma Nation).  She is married to former state senator Michael Robichaux and has three children: Josh, Jason, and Felicite.</note>

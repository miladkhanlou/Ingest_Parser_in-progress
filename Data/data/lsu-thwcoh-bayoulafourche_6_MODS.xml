  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Orgeron discusses his childhood, growing up on a farm in Valentine, Louisiana.  He recounts his early career at the Freeport Sulphur Company, which eventually moved him from Port Sulphur, Louisiana, to a 7/7 schedule on an offshore rig closer to Bayou Lafourche.  He took correspondence courses and advanced in the company; during his time on land he and his wife were busy building a new home and starting a family.  Orgeron discusses how he came to work for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port [LOOP].  He shares his religious beliefs; as a practicing Catholic he goes to church every Sunday and is involved in religious service groups.  He discusses life on the bayou, both in regards to flooding, how things were when he was a boy, and what has changed.  Orgeron sings the Cajun song "Allons Danser Colinda" and discusses his recent trip to Nova Scotia and his connection with the people there.</abstract>

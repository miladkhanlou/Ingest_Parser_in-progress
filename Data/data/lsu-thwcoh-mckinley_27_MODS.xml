  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Gray discusses growing up in Beauregard Town, a racially-mixed neighborhood, in the 1920s, 30s and 40s. She lists her family members who all lived on the same block that her grandfather, Levanski, had purchased from a French family. She recalls the geography of the neighborhood and surrounding areas: downtown Baton Rouge, the riverfront, Catfish Town, and South Baton Rouge. She talks about stores, restaurants, theaters, churches and businesses in the area. She recounts her time at Reddy Street School and McKinley High, and her experience as one of the first African American graduate students at LSU in the 1950s. She discusses race relations in Beauregard Town and Baton Rouge in the 1920s through 1950s.</abstract>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Murray recalls her time as a student at McKinley High School from 1970 to 1974.  She discusses the importance of academics, the teachers who were her role models, the popular fashions and hairstyles, the elected offices she held and honors she was bestowed, and the role that a McKinley education played in her career as a public servant.  She discusses the role of athletics at McKinley, the quality of the athletic programs, and the rivalry between McKinley and Capitol High School.  She ponders the influence of McKinley on Baton Rouge's history and the school's impact on the political life of African Americans in Baton Rouge.</abstract>

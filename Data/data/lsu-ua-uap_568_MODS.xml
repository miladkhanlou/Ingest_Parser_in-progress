   <note type="biographical/historical">Establishment of the Cooperative Extension Service officially began with the passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided federal funding for agricultural outreach to rural communities through land-grant universities. The Smith-Lever Act was the last of three acts established to work in tandem towards the advancement of agriculture throughout the United States. The Morrill Act was signed into law by President Lincoln in 1862 establishing state land-grant colleges for the teaching of engineering and agriculture. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided federal funds to state land-grant institutions for the creation of agricultural experiment stations in which to conduct research. The Cooperative Extension Service was designed to take the agricultural research and educational findings of the land-grant colleges and experiment stations out to the community of farmers, homemakers and youth of the country who did not have ready access to formal classes or study. Services and information provided by the Cooperative Extension Service has been, and continues to be, both extensive and diverse covering all aspects of agriculture, homemaking and self-sufficiency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sharing of information from colleges to the community had been practiced in various forms prior to the establishment of the Cooperative Extension Service. Learning through demonstration methods developed by Dr. Seaman A. Knapp had been utilized across the country since the early century. Louisiana was at the forefront of this agricultural and educational movement. By 1904 Dr. Knapp began a systematic program of demonstrations through the newly established Farmer's Cooperative Demonstration Work of the USDA. By 1909 demonstration work had been organized in 44 Louisiana parishes. The Agricultural College of LSU conducted its own version of community demonstration work through the Farmer's Institute and later the Farmer's Short Course. These extension endeavors were spearheaded by Dr. W.R. Dodson, and were designed for both agents and farmers to attend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The development of agricultural programs designed for youth and women were also of importance to demonstration work. Louisiana began its first Corn Club work in 1908, additional clubs followed including Boys' Pig Clubs, and Girls' Canning Clubs all under the Junior Extension Service. The establishment of state fairs and Demonstration Trains promoted the work of these Junior Extension clubs as well as encourage further public interest. Demonstration Trains of 1910 in Louisiana covered more than 1,000 miles and were attended by approximately 55,000 people in two weeks' time. The train exhibits and lectures from LSU Agricultural College brought information and research from LSU Experiment Stations to the masses for the improvement of agriculture across the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Cooperative Extension's primary goal was to provide information to the community about current developments in agriculture and animal husbandry, home economics, public policy concerning agriculture, leadership, youth clubs, economic development, and many other related subjects through printed materials and demonstration. Cooperative Extension continues to serve Louisiana and the nation with services and programs designed to best serve the community and its ever changing needs.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Louisiana Cooperative Extension photograph album, dated approximately 1906-1917, contains roughly 300 black and white photographs. The images cover a variety of agricultural topics including Louisiana State Fair exhibitions, Train Demonstrations, LSU agricultural and veterinary studies, Sugar and Rice Experiment Stations, forestry, Boy's Pig Clubs, livestock, and various crops and agricultural processes. Approximate dates of the album span the establishment of the Farmer's Cooperative Demonstration Work, the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service, as well as LSU School of Agriculture Farmer's Short Course. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is probable that the photographs primary purpose, besides documentation, was publication. Many photographs within the album are identified as the work of Baton Rouge photographer, Jasper G. Ewing. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Several photographs were published in the University Bulletin, Extension Circulars, or Louisiana Bulletin dated 1906-1920. Persons of note identified within the photograph album include W. H. Dalrymple, W. R. Dodson, Helen Graham, E. L. Jordan, Elizabeth B. Kelley, E. S. Richardson, and V. L. Roy. The photographic prints of varying sizes were pasted in a black paper album. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Several pages contain groupings of up to five photographs per page, as well as occasional front and back montages. Multiple image groupings typically cover a similar subject matter. An attempt to remove the photographs from the album pages was made in the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The removal process has left thirty-seven photograph groupings without their pages intact. The album also contains four loose photographs that were never pasted among its bound pages. The pagination of the album, as it was housed prior to processing, has been maintained.</abstract>

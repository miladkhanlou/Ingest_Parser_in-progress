   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Drawn by Samuel Lockett, this is the only known view of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning’s seventy-two-room building and grounds.  Located near Pineville in Rapides Parish on 438 acres, the Official Register of the Officers and Cadets (1866) said “the Seminary building was erected at great cost, and is one of the largest and finest college edifices in the South.”  It had 72 rooms and was also one of the largest buildings in the South to survive the Civil War intact.  On the morning of October 15, 1869, the building burned to the ground.</abstract>

   <note type="content">Technical Report Abstract: Land loss mapping and rate curve development for 12 US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles in the Louisiana Chenier Plain indicates the magnitude of land loss as well as the trend in land loss rates is highly variable. Two of the 12 quadrangles comprising the Chenier Plain show an increase in the land loss rate when comparing the middle period (1950's to 1974) to the most recent period (1974 to 1983). Three quadrangles have a constant rate. In the remaining seven quadrangles, the rate is decreasing. Differences in land loss rates among the individual quadrangles are a function of the geologic setting and the factors which contribute to land loss such as subsidence, storm-induced erosion, channelization of rivers and streams, and canal dredging. Specific causes of land loss are not evaluated in this study. Land loss rates for the entire Chenier Plain are presently decreasing from their high estimated to have occurred during the early 1970's. The average land loss rate as of 1983 for the Chenier plain is 7.74 square miles per year. On a regional scale, the land loss rate for the entire Mississippi River Deltaic and Chenier Plains is decreasing. The average land loss rate as of 1983 for the combined Mississippi River Deltaic and Chenier Plains (an area comprising 62 USGS topographic quadrangles) was 30.71 square miles per year. At its peak, approximately in the early 1970's, the average land loss rate was 41.88 square miles per year. Another data point is necessary to determine whether this decrease is continuing. Land loss data generated during this investigation are being combined with geologic data in a Geographic Information System to conduct detailed analyses of the causes of land loss in future reports.</note>

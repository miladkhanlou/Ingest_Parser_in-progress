   <note type="content">Between 1898 and 1913, work was conducted to create a sustainable channel 1,000 feet wide and 35 feet deep at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River delta.  Surveying, dredging, and construction of jetties, sills, and other structures took place during this period.  The jetties were completed in 1913 and their superstructure received necessary repairs in 1915 and 1916.  A major hurricane struck the Southwest Pass area on September 29, 1915.
Summary: Fourteen of eighteen annotated photographic prints document construction of jetties in the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River delta, while three concern the aftermath of the 1915 hurricane and one presents a view of Mardi Gras in New Orleans.</note>

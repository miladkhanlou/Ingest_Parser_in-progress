  <note type="content" displayLabel="Collection Description">&lt;h3&gt;Controlling the Waters: The United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Lower Mississippi River Valley&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout its 210-year existence, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has played a vital role in the history and economy of Louisiana. From the first "rivers and harbors" legislation, passed by Congress in 1824, up to the present day, the Corps' successes and failures have affected the everyday lives of our state's citizens, as well as their long-term economic and cultural well-being. Through the years, the Corps has produced thousands of technical reports and other publications documenting their research, experimentation, and projects. This collection offers a selection of this important documentation that is essential for an understanding of the state's current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As a partner in a federal documents cooperative coordinated by the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL), the LSU Libraries is a "Center of Excellence" for materials published by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). LSU Libraries is a comprehensive Regional Depository for federal government documents, and therefore has an extensive collection of USACE publications available for digitization. This collection is a small sampling of the rich USACE offerings available in Government Documents and Special Collections. In addition, there are historical materials from the Libraries' Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, which provide historical context for later developments, including publications on swamp land reclamation and levees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;As the collection continues to grow, it will provide a wealth of historical information of use to geoscientists, engineers, policy makers, businesses, historians, social scientists and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for this collection was provided in part by the Louisiana Board of Regents.&lt;/p&gt;</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A bust length portrait of a Mexican girl of Hispanic origin, three-quarter turned to the picture plane, is in realistic style. The dark-haired girl has her hair parted in the middle and tied with two bows. She appears to be about twelve years old and has a high forehead, large sparkling eyes, a long slender nose, delicate lips, and a long neck. She wears a sweater with a turned-down collar. The sweater has four stripes running down from each shoulder - two plain open stripes are separated by two black and white squiggle stripes. The background is medium green with an irregular swirl pattern.</abstract>

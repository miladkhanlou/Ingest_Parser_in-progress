   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Two human hands appear as if robbed of life and sinking into the depths of the well.</abstract>
   <note type="content">the initial drawing was made using pen and ink, brush and ink, and rubbing on the stone. The colors used are warm brown, yellow and black. The scene is, as the title translates,. The well.. The well represents a final resting place for Ms. Durieux. "wells always appeared sinister to me, " stated the artist. The tonal areas within the hands were created by rubbing.
the French printer working on the actual printing, Desjobert, felt an area needed to pick up more ink, thus printing a darker tone; therefore additional grease was needed in this area. The printer then took his finger and rubbed it behind his ear. By using this natural body oil rubber on the stone, he was able to add the additional " grease" thus allowing the stone to pick up more ink. Ms. Durieux, commenting on this trick-of-the-trade, said that she did learn a great deal from the French, although, "her head is not that greasy."</note>

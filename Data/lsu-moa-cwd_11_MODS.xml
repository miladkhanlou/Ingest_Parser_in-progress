   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The setting for the composition is a New Orleans Symphony performance attended by the artist.</abstract>
   <note type="content">the drawing on the stone was done with lithographic pencil and no scraping was employed. This fact was explained by Ms. Durieux . She stated that George Miller preferred works without scraping, so she designed the print without need for scraping. The negative and light areas were the result of just not working the areas, therefore making scraping unnecessary.</note>

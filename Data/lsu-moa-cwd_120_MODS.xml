   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print presents abstracted stick-like representations of human legs and feet, all of which are directed as though moving across the picture plane. Ms. Durieux stated that these legs and feet carry the people away in one direction. She stated that the mass movement of such large bodies of people, as witnessed in the subway terminals, recalled the mass migrations of lemmings, small furry footed rodents of Europe.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The print is a three colored lithograph in greyed-yellow, greyed-light blue and a whitish grey with a slight amount of pink added for warmth. The artist related that the idea for this design came to her after experiencing the rush hour of the Paris metro.</note>

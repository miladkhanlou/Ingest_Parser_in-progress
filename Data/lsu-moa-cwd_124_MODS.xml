   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The subject matter is an abstracted composition of pentagon forms made of lines created by brush work.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The isotope used in this print was Sulfur 35 combined with four color matrices. The colors present in the print are grey, dark greyish-green, blue-grey and red. The artist explained that the dark areas were created by overprinting. The dark dots seen in the print result from printing twice in dark grey then overprinting with red.  Ms. Durieux remarked that all the lines in the print were made using various brushes, varying in degrees of fineness.</note>

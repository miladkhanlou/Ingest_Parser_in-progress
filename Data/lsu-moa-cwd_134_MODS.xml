   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Ms. Durieux related that the subject represents Medusa, which she feels man always associates with fright. She feels the print suggested the mood of fright, an emotion many shared during the 1950's when man was aware of the growing horror the atomic bomb was capable of creating.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This is an electron print made by the artist at LSU using the isotope Sulfur 35. Dr. Olan Nance served as her assistant for the printing of this edition. A rough fibered paper  deliberately used in order for the print to reproduce the textured patterning of these fibers in the final print. The initial drawing was made with a wash of radioactive ink with lines applied using pen and ink.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A curvilinear outlined form is superimposed over the background. The central mass is worked in shades of red as are smaller spiral forms, one of which is appears in each quadrant of the print. The background is a red ground color with an over-printing of green-blue spots. The darkest of the outlines are the result of printing all the colors over and together in these areas. In order to deepen the color and emphasize the areas, an overprinting of blue is used. The larger forms create a movement up and down within the composition.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This is a color electron print printed with the three primary colors only. The print is worked from top to bottom in blue-green stripes with touches of yellow. The artist noted that the work loses the effect of a happy rhythm when the composition is turned upside down.</note>

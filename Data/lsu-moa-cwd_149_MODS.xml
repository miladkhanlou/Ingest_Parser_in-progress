   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This lithograph was printed from a zinc plate worked by the artist and sent to George Miller in New York for printing. The print is included in those considered to belong to Ms. Durieux's "North American Series". The name for this series is derived from the fact that Ms. Durieux uses all American "types" in these prints. The method of drawing used for this print was achieved by using a lithographic pencil, crayon, and some ink. The scene depicts an opening of exhibition of abstract art in which the participants appear rather ignorant of the works and their meanings. "It's all rather new to them as seen by their expressions.. The setting is a pseudo-classical gallery in which the classical feel of the background columns contrasts with the ornate frames of the art works, which in turn contrasts with their contents. All of this adds to the incongruous atmosphere and adds to the satire of the print.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene depicts a French beach and is typical of the "sights" one might see enjoying the beaches. Four men and women sit on the benches. Two of them are talking to each other.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The drawing, done on stone, was made using lithographic pencil, crayon and ink. Scraping was used in desired areas. It is interesting that the print has an overprinting of reduced pink ink applied to add color to the work. In addition, this edition  was printed on cream toned paper, also adding warmth to the prints. Ms Durieux stated that the "types" seen in the print are representative of those general personalities she'd see when visiting the beaches herself.</note>

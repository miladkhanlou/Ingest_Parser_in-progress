   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The subject depicted is a creature who seems content and protected behind a shelter of cross bars.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The three colors used are dark purple, greenish- yellow and a white overprinting. The initial drawing made by the artist was done using a lithographic pencil. Scraping was used to create white lines throughout the composition. The creature, which is doglike in appearance, is claimed by the artist to be a figment of her own imagination. It is neither dog nor fox but is definitely a wild creature which has taken refuge from man and nature behind the shelter provided.</note>

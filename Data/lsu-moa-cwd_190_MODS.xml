   <abstract displayLabel="Description">An explosion of a stellar mass.</abstract>
   <note type="content">In this cliché verre print, the artist used a single matrix. The different shades of blue were achieved by varying the thickness levels of the emulsion on the matrix. The negative areas were the result of scraping away portions of the emulsion from the matrix. The title, which clearly describes the composition, once brought a query to the artist. Ms. Durieux was informed by a young scientist that all stellar explosions were yellow. Ms. Durieux warmly replied that such may be the case, but her explosion was blue.</note>

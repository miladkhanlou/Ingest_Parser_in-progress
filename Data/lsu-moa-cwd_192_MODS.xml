   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This scene was suggested by an actual Mexican beggar whose memory haunted the artist for years after a trip to Vera Cruz  in Mexico. Ms. Durieux stated that she employed no exaggeration, as the unfortunate man appeared as depicted. The bent, twisted limbs with their ragged pads indicated he had never stood upright, but lived in a wretched condition. Ms. Durieux continued to elaborate on the figure by saying he was unable to speak as well. She remarked that Katherine Ann Porter, in her book Ship of Fools, mentions and describes this same beggar. The beggar was in actuality, doing just fine financially with his begging.. The artist stated that due to his horror, people would give him money just to leave their presence. He found it advantageous to beg at the hotel sidewalk cafes.</abstract>

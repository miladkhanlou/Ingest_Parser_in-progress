   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print depicts a costume created and worn by Mr. Eddie Dreyer one Carnival Day. The idea behind the costume is that of casting pearls to swine, thus the enormous pig's head decorated with hundreds of pearls. In the print, Ms. Durieux has developed the central element three times, slightly changing it each time, to create the desired pattern. The pattern also suggests the setting, that Victor's Bar at the corner of Chartres and Toulouse in the French Quarter. It seems that Victor's would set out tables with checkered cloths on its sidewalk every Mardi Gras as a courtesy to its customers.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The satire of the print is obvious. The lady is depicted apparently feeling quite "stylish" in her hat. The bird which sets upon the hat conveys an association with its wearer. Note the similarity of their eyes, and the handling of the beak and nose. The lady appears to look like the product of a taxidermist and does the bird on her hat. The treatment of the wings arch upward suggesting antler-like appendages of the woman. Antlers are often considered trophies, as are stuffed birds, thus the satire is stated. Ms. Durieux related that she actually saw this woman while waiting in line at the bus depot. That which fascinated the artist is seen in the print.</abstract>

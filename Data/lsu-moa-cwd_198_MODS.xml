   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In the best tradition of Durieux's satirical drawings this image pokes good-natured fun at a supposedly sophisticated theater audience in the lobby at intermission time. Note that the men are mostly middle aged and balding and the artist exaggerated the longer hair styles and full side burns in addition to the wearing of turtlenecks shirts with either a pendent on a gold chain (man in the middle ground left) or bolo tie (man on right).</abstract>
   <note type="content">This drawing is the study sketch for the black and white cliché vérre 1975 print of the same name (Acc. no. 76.12.21 in this collection)</note>

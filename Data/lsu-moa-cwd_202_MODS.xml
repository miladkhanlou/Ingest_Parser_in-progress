   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Abstract design suggestive of the tracery of a window or perhaps a spider's web.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print ranks among the earliest  of the electron prints done by Ms. Durieux. Therefore, it is of an experimental nature. Ms. Durieux related that only a few prints were in this edition as she was experimenting to see if a color electron print was possible. The print is made from a single matrix with a thick emulsion film. It was printed in three colors: light red, yellow, and purplish-grey. The light red areas were created using a brush dipped in the radioactive dye and literally applied to the matrix.</note>

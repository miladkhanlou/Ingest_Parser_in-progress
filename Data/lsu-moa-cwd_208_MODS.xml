   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The artist commented that the scene represents various debris often found drifting and floating in water. The subject matter related to a favorite pastime of the artist, the sea-side and water related activities. Ms. Durieux stated that sea-forms have always fascinated her and such allows for an interesting patterning within the picture plane.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The colors used are green-grey, pinkish-grey, brownish grey, and a thick bluish white. The drawing was made by the artist using a lithographic pencil with lithographic ink and brush. The artist allows the white of the paper to serve as additional color in the print, thus white shapes are created simply by not printing over these areas</note>

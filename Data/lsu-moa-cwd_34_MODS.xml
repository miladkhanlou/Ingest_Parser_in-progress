   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Primarily the four men sitting around the circular bar room table loom larger than in the cartoon and their seated position in the chairs has been changed slightly. Their faces have all been made more porcine and all the men wear grey suits (the one with his back to the picture plane has a pinstripe) rather than white linen. Also, each man wears a white dress shirt.. The four men are seated in green cane bottom chairs having spool-turned rear stiles and three plain balusters for a splat. The only chair back that is fully shown is the one being used by the man with his back to the picture plane. The table at which they sit has a green top and the edge is black. The men at nine, three and six o'clock positions hold tiny stemmed liqueur glasses filled with a lime green colored drink. Each man wears a yellow boater with either circular or zigzag green lines creating the illusion of the straw pattern. Each hat also has a black silk band. The very fat bald man in the twelve o'clock position has a cigarette hanging out the right side of his mouth and he cuts his eyes to his right toward the man sitting in the nine o'clock position.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This painting is Ms. Durieux's own version of the art moderne style, and is widely regarded as her finest oil painting. It was executed in Mexico City - her son told HPB that there was a "Cafe Tupinamba" in that city when he, his mother and father lived there. This painting differs in a number of respects from the highly finished drawing "Cafe Tupinamba" (Acc. No. 91.25).</note>

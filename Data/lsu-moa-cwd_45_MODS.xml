   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The scene depicts the traditional meeting of Comus and Rex on Mardi Gras night. Each "monarch" reigns over his own Carnival ball, both balls being held simultaneously. Then, at a decided time just before midnight, the two monarchs meet in a traditional ceremony which allows Rex to rule, truly as "the" King of Carnival. One may note that Comus, as tradition dictates, is masked. This adds to the gossip and "speculation" as to who "is" Comus by the ladies in the foreground of the composition.</abstract>
   <note type="content">The print is included among those in Ms. Durieux's Plug-Mardi Gras Series.ardtec the print, done on stone, was drawn using lithographic pencil.</note>

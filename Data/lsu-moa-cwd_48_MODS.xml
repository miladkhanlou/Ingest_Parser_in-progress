   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This lithograph was printed in Mexico City at the studio of Senefelders. The artist used a lithographic pencil, crayon and scraping.. The inspiration for this print came from the fact that personal dressmakers were quite popular in Mexico City. Ms. Durieux had two Mexican dressmakers whose shop she frequently visited. It was during one of these visits that the artist witnessed a similar situation as that depicted in the print. In this print the artist has exaggerated the female customer for the sake of satire. The two female attendants are definitely Mexican-Indian types as compared to the Spanish characteristics of the customer.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The print depicts another interpretation of a favorite subject of the artist -- that of escape.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This print was made by the artist while at LSU. In this work the artist presents an active composition in which two hands serve as the central focal point. The hands clutch desperately at the top edge of a brick wall. The fingers appear to scratch deep into the bricks while crumbling particles fall in a patterned play  of white, grey and black. The surfaces throughout the composition are activated by the texturing of each. The dark foreboding sky in the background appears heavy and threatening as it is composed of thick bold brush lines made to appear even darker by several overlays of washes.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This cliche-verre is worked in shades of grey. The design of the print  suggests the frenzy of the various sea creatures.</abstract>
   <note type="content">A later edition of this print was reworked by the artist in which a yellow color was added. The artist related that she feels the yellow greatly enhances the results of the printing.  A single matrix was used in this print with the negative areas created by scraping away the emulsion from the matrix. Ms. Durieux  recalled her intention when first designing the print. It seems she was  invited to spend a weekend on the gulf coast at the LSU Wetlands experimental Station in Ocean Springs, Ms. While on this excursion, the artist experienced a number of fishing-related activities. Her experiences influenced her design.</note>

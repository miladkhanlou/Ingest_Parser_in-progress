   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The subject is a whimsical one for the artist. By allowing the color of the print to create a mood, she arranges "ghostly" looking peanut forms in the composition. These forms appear to be descending a curving stair case and stare out to the viewer appearing as apparitions within their environment. Each form appears to emerge from a darkened cloud-like outline wile bold white lines define each form.</abstract>
   <note type="content">This is an etching using the line and aquatint techniques and was printed at the home studio of M. Durieux. The print was made using white ink on blue oriental paper.</note>

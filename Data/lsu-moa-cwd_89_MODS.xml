   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The drawing was done with a lithographic pencil, ink, and crayon. Scraping within the composition is used to create texturing. The flat black of the golfer's shoes was created by painting directly on the stone with ink applied with a brush. The satire is based on the ridiculousness of the golfer's mode of dress. The character is suggestive of an American appearing rather absurd in his blooming, bellowing plus fours. To emphasize this situation, the artist has placed the golfer against a background in which nature is not ridiculous. Ms. Durieux related that she obviously was not a golfer herself: "I don't love golf, although I've tried to learn...but, with the beautiful landscape of the Mexican countryside, I was more interested in the scenery than the game."</abstract>

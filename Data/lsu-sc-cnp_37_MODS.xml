   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This view shows the position where fought the 14th Louisiana Battalion about midday on the 20th September, 1863. It was about 350 yard east from the point in Thomas' breastworks carried in the evening by Adams' Louisiana Brigade, which is shown in Views No. 17 and 18, and about 250 yards from the Northeast face of these forks. The view is facing Southwest. The white stake is about the center of the line occupied by the Battalion, and is about 150 yards North of East from the monument erected on the spot where fell Gen'l Helm. At about 10 a.m. The pyramid of cannon balls erected to him can be seen further in the forest, to the right of the white stake. This position was fixed on the 25th September, 1894, by the National Commissioners, assisted by J. F. Dicks of said Battalion, who was severely wounded here in the battle, and was marked by W. A. Woods of the engineer department of the National Commission and figures in field notes as 4th Louisiana Battalion Line 32-E. 10'.-W. 10x130.</abstract>

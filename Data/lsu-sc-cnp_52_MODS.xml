   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The view shows the bank of the Chickamauga at Red house crossing. The river is hidden by the forest growth which fringes it very heavily. The crossing is no longer a public highway and is reached through cultivated fields on both banks. This is the western bank. This crossing derived its name from a red house near it, which has been constructed by the Indians, and was torn down by the federals to make a bridge of at the crossing.A great deal of fighting occurred on both sides of the river at this point during the 18th, 19th and 20th September.</abstract>

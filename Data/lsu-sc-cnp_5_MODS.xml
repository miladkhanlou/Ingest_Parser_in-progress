The First Louisiana and Eighth Arkansas were the extreme left of Govan's Brigade. Shortly after entering the fields, they were struck on the left flank by Turchin's Federal Brigade supported by Robinson's, forcing their way out in retreat towards Cloud's House and McFarland's Gap to the northwest. Govan's Brigade was thrown into disorder and driven out the fields into the woods to the east of the road. Walthall was likewise driven back into the woods. At sundown they advanced again into these fields west of the road, and remained there until going into bivouac.The batteries of Govan's and Walthall's Brigades were also in these fields.View No 11.In View No. 11 is seen more especially that part of the fields looking northwest towards the position of Cloud's house, (now destroyed), that stood on the elevation shown by the woods-near the right of the view.

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Much of the Arctic abounds in water because of the presence of numerous lakes and rivers. However, such a condition only occurs during the short summer. During most of the year, liquid water is rare and only occurs beneath the ice in the deeper lakes and river channels. Although much snow and ice are present, converting them to liquid water is time consuming and expensive. Because permafrost dominates, ground water is usually unavailable. The article describes the various techniques used in the production of water in the Arctic.</abstract>

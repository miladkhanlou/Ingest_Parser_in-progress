  <note type="content" displayLabel="Collection Description">&lt;p&gt;Louis Hasselmans was the son of the Belgian harpist Alphonse Hasselmans and the grandson of Joseph Hasselmans. He received his musical education at the Paris Conservatoire where he studied cello, composition, and conducting. He toured Europe as cellist with the Capet Quartet (1893-1909) and had his debut as a conductor with the Lamoureaux Orchestra in Paris in 1905. His conducting career began in 1909 and included seasons with the Opera Comique in Paris (1909-1911); in Montreal, Canada (1911-1913); with the Chicago Civic Opera (1918-1920); and the Metropolitan Opera as its director of French repertory (1921-1936). Hasselmans was a professor of music at Louisiana State University (1936-1948). He was married to Minnie Egener and died in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

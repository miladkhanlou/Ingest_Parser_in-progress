   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The camp name is misspelled "Grouce" verso. It should read Camp Groce, which was a Confederate training facility and prisoner of war camp near the present day town of Hempstead, TX. Prisoners first arrived after the Battle of Galveston, 01 January 1863. By December 1863 all prisoners were evacuated to Camp Ford near Tyler, TX., and Camp Groce closed. Due to overcrowding in Camp Ford after the Union's Red River Campaign failed, Camp Groce was reopened in July 1864 and remained open until the end of the War. Gen. George Armstrong Custer and his command camped here 01 September - 01 December 1865. [Source: Handbook of Texas]</abstract>

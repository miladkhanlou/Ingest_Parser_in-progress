   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Work began on a fort at Mobile Bay’s entrance in 1819. The fort was built at Mobile Point, located at the western extreme of the peninsula that stretches across much of Mobile Bay’s mouth. Completed in 1834, the fort was named Fort Morgan in honor of General Daniel Morgan, a Revolutionary War hero.The Mobile Point lighthouse was completed by June of 1822 at an expense of 9,995. The lamps in the lantern room atop the forty-foot brick tower were lit for the first time on September 29, 1822. The lighthouse stood on a bluff near the southwest corner of the star-shaped Fort Morgan.Following the outbreak of the War Between the States, Confederate forces took control of the fort, and the Mobile Point Light was deactivated. At dawn on August 5, 1864, a fleet of eighteen Union ships commanded by Admiral David Farragut approached the entrance to Mobile Bay. A fierce exchange of cannon fire ensued at 7:30 AM, during which the Tecumseh, a Union vessel, struck a mine and sank. The incident threw the Union fleet into disarray. The remaining vessels sailed into the bay and succeeded in capturing the fort on August 23. During the battle for the fort, the lighthouse was struck multiple times, severely damaging one side of the tower. The camera stands at eye level looking toward and past the ruins of the lighthouse on the dunes. The verso inscribed, "Mobile Point - 15 inch"</abstract>

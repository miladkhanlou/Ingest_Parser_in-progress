   <abstract displayLabel="Description">From 841 to 847, Usuard was a monk at Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. His journey through Spain in 858 led to the incorporation of Spanish saints into his work on martyrs, which remained throughout the Middle Ages the most famous document of its kind and is preserved in numerous later manuscripts, such as this one.  

Originating in Prague at the court of Wenceslas IV, this 15th-century copy of Usuard’s Martyrology plays a key role in the history of Central-European painting, constituting a high point in the evolution of the Bohemian tradition of book illumination.</abstract>

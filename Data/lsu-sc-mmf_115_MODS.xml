   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The North French Hebrew Miscellany comprises 84 different groups of texts, including poems, legal codes, and material related to marriage, divorce, rituals, and business transactions.  Among other texts included are the Pentateuch, Haftarot, Pirkei Avot, the Mezuzah, the Book of Tobit, and Isaac de Corbeilâ€™s Sefer Mitsvot Katan.  The miscellany is an important source of sacred Hebrew poetry.  Most of the poems fall into the category of Yotseroth, cycles of poems related to the morning prayer service.  Other categories include Sabbath table-songs, petitions for forgiveness, and songs for the Jewish festival of Sukkoth.

This is a fine and rare example of Ashkenazi Hebrew manuscript illumination, and  it contains several dozen full-page illustrations of biblical scenes and figures, including Aaron, David, Moses, Abraham, Judith, David and Goliath, the Tree of Life, the Tabernacle, Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace, the Nine Spheres, and the Judgment of Solomon.  The manuscript is also rich in marginal decorations, many of which feature birds and other animals.</abstract>

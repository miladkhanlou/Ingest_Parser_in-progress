   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Written by the Arab physician Ububchasym of Baldach (also known as Ellucasim Elimittar) in the mid 11th century, the Theatrum Sanitatis is a treatise on medicine.  The work was widely popular in the 14th and 15th centuries and espouses medicine based on rational observations rather than superstition/folklore.  This codex is a summary of the original work, with illustrations.  According to the author, health is based on six factors:  climate, food and drink, movement and rest, sleep and wakefulness, happiness, pain and sadness.  Illness and disease result these factors become imbalanced.

The therapeutic properties of various foods, plants, and animal products are described, and basic rules of hygiene are laid out.  In addition to plants, the manuscript’s 208-illustrations also depict a variety of scenes from daily life in the Middle Ages, including cooking, wine making, harvesting, horse riding, hunting, fencing, dancing, and sex.  Tradesmen are also represented, including butchers, candlemakers, beekeepers, apothecaries, potters, and tailors.</abstract>

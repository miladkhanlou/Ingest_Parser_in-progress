   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The physician, poet, and grammarian Nicander of Colophon lived in the 2nd century BCE, working at the court of king Attalus III of Pergamum. The poem Theriaka concerns the bites of poisonous insects, snakes and wild animals; Alexipharmaka, concerns other poisons of plant and mineral origin and contains information on precautions and antidotes. 

Theriaka is divided into three sections:  descriptions of poisonous animals, symptoms of their bites and stings, and remedies for poisoning.  Alexipharmaka, also in three parts, deals with poisonous solutions, symptoms, and remedies. 

This is the only extant illustrated example of Nicander’s work.  Forty of the forty-eight folios in the codex feature miniatures illustrating the text.</abstract>

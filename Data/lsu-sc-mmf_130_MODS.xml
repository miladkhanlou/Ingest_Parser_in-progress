   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Probably the most important illuminated manuscript of the 15th century, the Très Riches Heures (“The Very Rich Hours”) is an elaborately decorated prayer book that was  commissioned by Jean, Duc de Berry circa 1410.  It consists of 416 pages, including 131 with large miniatures and many more with border decorations or historiated initials, that are among the high points of International Gothic painting in spite of their small size. There are 300 decorated capital letters.  The illustrations, many of which include images of the duke’s chateaux, depict scenes related to the seasons, including a New Year’s banquet, sowing the fields, autumn harvest, picking grapes, hawking, and a boar hunt.</abstract>

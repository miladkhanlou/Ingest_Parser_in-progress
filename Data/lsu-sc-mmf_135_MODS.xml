   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Vergilius Vaticanus is the best preserved example of a book illustrated in the Greco-Roman tradition and constitutes one of the oldest sources of Virgil’s Aeneid.  Produced in Rome around 400 A.D., it is also the oldest of the three surviving classical manuscripts containing illustrations of classical literature (the others being the Vergilius Romanus and the Ambrosian Iliad). 

The text is interspersed with 50 miniatures, the color illustrations of which exhibit parallels to Greek-influenced wall paintings at Pompeii. Only 76 leaves of the manuscript survive, containing fragments of Virgil’s Georgics in addition to the Aeneid.    If it contained all of Virgil’s works, the manuscript originally would have had about 440 leaves and 280 illustrations. The text was written by a single scribe in rustic capitals with no separation between words. The illustrations are bordered by ornate golden frames and include landscapes and architectural details. 

The manuscript was probably made for a pagan noble. Annotations indicate it was in Italy until the 7th century and in Tours in the second quarter of the 9th century. A French scribe made further notes around 1400.</abstract>

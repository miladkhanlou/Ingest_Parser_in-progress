   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This manuscript, known as the Morgan Beatus, was apparently produced at the monastery of San Miguel de Escalada by Maius (or Magius), fl. 926-968.  It is the oldest example of a revived Spanish apocalypse tradition.  The illuminations reflect a stylistic and cultural revolution taking place in the newly reclaimed territories of the Iberian peninsula.  Of note are the brilliantly painted portraits of the Evangelists. 

The Apocalypse and commentary by Saint Beatus of Li√©bana became one of the most important religious texts of the Middle Ages, and was often fully illustrated.  The Morgan Beatus contains preliminary material with brilliantly painted Evangelist portraits (f. 1-9), Beatus's Commentary on the Apocalypse, (f.10-233), excerpts from Isidore of Seville's De ad finitatibus et gradibus and of his Etymologies (f.234r-237r), St. Jerome's Commentary on Daniel, (f. 239-293), and a third exposition of the Apocalypse (f.294-299).</abstract>

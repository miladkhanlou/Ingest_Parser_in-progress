   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The title "Carmina Burana" literally means “songs of Beuren” and was given by Johann Andreas Schmeller to his complete edition (1847) of the poems contained in an early 13th-century German manuscript (discovered in 1803) from the Benedictine abbey of Benediktbeuern, south of Munich.  Since then, the manuscript has been known by that title even though it is now generally agreed that it probably did not originate in Benediktbeuern and may have come from Seckau. The manuscript is perhaps the most important source for Latin secular poetry of the 12th-century goliardic repertory. There are some poems in German, and several of the poems have music written in unheighted neumes, a relatively rare style of notation at the time. In total, the manuscript contains approximately 250 poems.

The pieces, mostly in Latin, with a few in a dialect of Middle High German and Old French, were written by students and clergy around 1230. Most of the poems and songs appear to be the work of Goliards, clergy (mostly students) who lampooned and satirized the Church. The collection preserves the works of a number of poets, including Peter of Blois, Walter of Châtillon, and an anonymous poet referred to as the Archpoet.</abstract>

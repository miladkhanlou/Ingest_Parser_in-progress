   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Also known as the Liber Sancti Jacobi, this manuscript is a guidebook for pilgrims traveling to the shrine of the apostle St. James in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.  The text was long thought to have been written by Pope Callixtus II, but scholars now believe that it is the work of Callixtus’s secretary, the French scholar Aymeric Picaud.  

The Codex Callixtinus is divided into five sections.  The first contains sermons, liturgical texts and homilies for the liturgy of St. James.  The second recounts miracles attributed to the him.  This is followed by a history of the transfer of St. James’s body from Jerusalem to Galicia.  The fourth book, which was reincorporated into the manuscript in 1964 after being removed from the codex in the seventeenth century, is a history of Charlemagne’s failed attempt in the eighth century to liberate Spain and the tomb of St. James from the Moors; it also contains an account of the death of the knight Roland at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778.  The fifth and final book contains practical advice for pilgrims traveling to Santiago de Compostela.  This manuscript is also an important source of medieval polyphonic music and contains the earliest known composition for three voices.</abstract>

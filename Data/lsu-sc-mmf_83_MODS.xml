   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Collection of plainchant, polyphonic mass movements, motets, and polyphonic chansons.
Containing 334 polyphonic and monophonic entries, the manuscript is the sole source dateable into the early fifteenth century devoted exclusively to French (or at least French-derived) music.  The range and origins of its repertory, combining plainchant for the Office and the Mass with polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary, motets, and a vast collection of French songs in the formes fixes, all apparently composed for the royal court of Cyprus, make the manuscript unique among codices of late medieval music.  Moreover, a Mass cycle copied in the back of the manuscript as a later addition offers rare musical evidence from a period that witness the genesis of one of the central genres of Western art music.</abstract>

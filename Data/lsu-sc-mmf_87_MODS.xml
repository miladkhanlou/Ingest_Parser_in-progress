   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Squarcialupi Codex is one of the most notable fifteenth-century Italian music anthologies. Its 300 pieces represent nearly all of the most renowned composers of the fourteenth century.

The codex is richly illuminated with gold and pigment. The miniatures and illuminations originated in the Florentine scriptorium of Santa Maria degli Angeli between 1410 and 1415. An inscription states that the codex once belonged to the Florentine organist Antonio Squarcialupi (1417-1480). It was later owned by Giuliano deâ€™ Medici and subsequently passed to the Palatine Library; at the end of the eighteenth century it was transferred together with other volumes to the Laurentian Library.</abstract>

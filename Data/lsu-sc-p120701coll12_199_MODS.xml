Here, there is no time\nfor discussing the wisdom or expediency of a command,\u2014no\ntime for wordy contests between the \" letter\" nnd \" spirit\" of\nthe law, which regulates relative duties, lest the moment for\nexecuting be lost, in dispute about the manner. Orders must\nbe instantly obeyed, and during the leisure which may succeed, discuss their propriety: for each officer is amenable\nto a tribunal of his fellow-soldiers for every movement. That\na course of training is necessary to implicit obedience, every\none knows who has examined his own repugnance to being\nordered. Many of our Southern youth find it accord very\nill with their preconceived notions of liberty and courtesy,\nto do nothing as they choose, and be commanded, in an imperious manner, in the military academy. And we have often\nheard the Southern \"Pleib,\" (as the entering cadet is called,)\nlo say, on return from a drill in which he has figured most\nclumsily, thai \"he would have performed ten times better, if\nbe had been asked or invited in a gentlemanly maimer\/' Yet,\nby continued habit, cadets are so accustomed to orders on\nduty, that to substitute courteous invitation, would appear as\ninsincere and ridiculous, ns orders bad originally seemed imperious and insulting.\u2014A second and equally important object, is, to instil habits of promptitude and punctuality,\u2014the\nlining of every thing precisely at the lime and in the manner\nprescribed, without special command. And the regular recurrence of duties in military schools, without the possibility\nof evasion, is strangely efficient in eliciting-such hnbits. And\nso deeply are they incorporated into die character, thnt they\ninsensibly ramify into all the business of civil, as well as of\nmilitary life. Again: warfare always exposes more or less\nto privation and hardship, which, without iniatory training,\ncould be borne but at the expense of health and efficiency,\nnnd oftentimes of life. To subsist upon the coarsest, least,\nand most indifferent provisions, and at the same time perform\nthe most arduous duties; to breast the severity of winter's\ncold and summer's heat, to be exposed to loss of sleep, drenching rain, or parching thirst, and yet to peisevere with assiduity and even avidity, in the discharge of duty\u2014because his\ncountry, his own beloved country, demands it\u2014these are a\nfew of the hardships to which the soldier's life is exposed.\nThe illustrious Washington, (with becoming reverence be\nthat name pronounced,) experienced them all in their most\nafflicting form; and saw many of the noblest patriot hearts\nsink beneath the struggle, (or lack of early training to exposure; and it was then that he formed those resolutions and\nprinciples, upon which was founded, at a later day, the United\nStates' Military Academy.\nYet every capability of physical endurance were attained\nto no purpose, if (be principles of the possessor be radically\nwrong. He must be enlisted, heart as well as band, in the\nservice of his country\u2014he must be actuated by loftier views\nand nobler patriotism than pecuniary gain can inspire: and\nhe must feel his bosom thrill with the pride and daring of a\ngenuine soldier, at every call of his country for his services.\nTo excite these emotions, and establish these principles, foun\nanother object of military education; and this is effected by\nmodels of greatness nnd devotion to country, taken from the\nhistory of all nations, but chiefly of his own.    Who thnt\never knew a soldier's pride, can read the biography of a j&gt;,\u201e\nnam, or a (&gt;rci n, a Washington, or a Bolivar, a Cincinnati,,\nor Leonidas, without one emotion, or wish to resemble Infm\nBy observing and celebrating national festivals, to the m(.|r.0\nry of glorious deeds; and with song, and jubilee, and m,ir.\ntial pomp, commemorating the virtues of (he immortal dead.\nby wnving the banners under which patriots have fought for\nbleeding liberty, and marching to airs that freshen the memory of triumph in battle,\u2014by these the flame of patriotism il\nenkindled in the youthful soldier's bosom,\u2014a flame which\nbums till the lamp of life flickers out.\nIn connection with the objects of military institutions, i\u00bb\nshall insist upon the utility of these objects; a task whtcli\nwere superfluous, but for the strange hostility, recently gotten\nup, in quarters whence more enlightened views might \\1Cf%\npected.\nAll who rend the correspondence of Washington, (aneleb\nI not give offence by supposing there are any present who do\nnot?) will remember bow often he repeats and lament} the\ndifficulty ol obtaining military engineers. He writes lorn,\nry quaiter, offering almost any compensation, and ordering\nthose who have the acquirements, wherever found in llionr-\nmy, to be released from every other duly, lo supply the impe,-\native demands of the service. How often does he atlrilinie\ndisaster to want of fortifications, the means of scientific attack, ignorant artillerists, and undisciplined, though brave.\ncommanders? Anil it was at a time when our country ira\nbeing blessed wilh the first fruils of dear-bought liberty, and\nenjoyed the fairest prospect of permanent peace, ihat he insisted\nupon the establishment of a school for the education of ofi\neers. His advice was always prudent\u2014the result of reflection j\u2014in this case experience had made him wise.\nThe profession of military engineering is one which fen\nwill learn for the chances of employment, when his country\nmay go to war: and civil engineers, if even these were pin-\nty. are, in most cases, inefficient substitutes. For scientific\nartillerists there is no substitute: for few citizens are ledbr\nbare curiosity to analyze the parabolic curve described byl\nshell, or the exact mathematical force required to throw\nball of known dimensions loa given distance. In thedepai\nment of military surveying and drafting, we should never,\nperhaps, find an expert hand that had not been trained on purpose. The ordinary drawer of pretty landscapes wonU\nserve but to mislead and confuse. It is to one trained to the\nobservation of those minute and evanescent irregulaiiwi\nwhich are usually deemed plain, and to such only, that a\nbe entrusted the correct representation of grounds; and toll*\nperformance of such a task, a much more thorough IfflC*\nledge of the principles of his art, are essential, than is voluntarily learned. Correct representation in drawing, is a me*\nof improving the observation, and correct draftsmen, alow\ncan be entrusted with the proper recollection of grounds for\naction. It thus becomes important, that all military effictr;\nshould be well taught in the science of perspective, and IB\ndrawing dependent upon it. \" An action is often lough' I;\npositions,\u2014by means of mana'uvrcs based upon features*\nground apparently the most trivial.

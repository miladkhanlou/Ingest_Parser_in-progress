Samuel Parker, gives the following curious account of a broatl defile through these mountains, which affords a commodious and easy passage from the country lying\neast of this grcat range to the territory on the coast ofthe Pacific. The existence of such a passage increases the importance of the steps in contemplation by our government, to occupy the territory on the Oregon.\n\"The passage through these mountains is in a valley, so\ngradual in tho ascent and descent, that I should not have\nknown we were passing them, had it not been that as we advanced the atmosphere gradually became cooler, and at\nlength we found the perpetual snows upon our right hand\nand upon our left, elevated many thousand feet above us\u2014in\nsome places ten thousand. The highest part of these mountains are found by measurement to be eighteen thousand feet\nabove, the level of the sea. This valley was not discovered\nuntil some years since.\n\" Mr. Hunt and his party, more than twenty years ago,\nwent near it, but did not find it, though in search of some favorable passage. It varies in width from five to twenty miles;\nand following its course, tho distance through the mountains\nis about eighty miles, or four days journey. Though there\nare some elevations and depressions in this valley, yet, comparatively speaking, it is level. There would be no difficulty\nin the way of constructing a rail road from the Atlantic to\nthe Pacific ocean; and probably the time may not be very far\ndistant, when trips will be made across the continent, as they\nhave been made to Niagara falls, to see nature's wonders.\"\nERRATA.\nPage 237, 2d column, lGih line, fur \" simoon,\" read simoom.\nTage 212, 1st column, 2d line, tor \" Pattabozzi,\" read Pestalozzi\nPage 242, 2d column, 13 lines from the bottom, for \" Pyercnn,'\nread Pierian.\nTruth is the only intellectual gold.\n","fullrs":{},"find":"620.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2010-10-08","dmmodified":"2016-06-22","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"619","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"1822764","cdmfilesizeformatted":"1.74 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Ezekiel John Ellis, attorney and congressman, was born Oct. 15, 1840, in St. Tammany Parish, La., to Ezekiel Parke Ellis and Tabitha Warner Ellis. He received his early education in Covington and Clinton, La., and later attended Centenary College at Jackson, La., graduating in 1858. He studied law at the University of Louisiana in New Orleans (now Tulane University) obtaining his law degree in 1861. At the onset of the Civil War, he enlisted in the Confederate army as a first lieutenant and was later promoted to captain in the 16th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Army of Tennessee. His regiment participated in the Confederate Heartland Offensive. He was sent to Johnson Island, Lake Erie, Ohio, after his capture at the Battle of Missionary Ridge in February of 1863. He remained a prisoner at Johnson Island for the duration of the war and was paroled in June of 1865. After the war he returned to Amite, where he served as editor to the Amite Daily Wanderer until 1866, and then moved to Covington to open a law practice. Ellis was an active member of the Democratic Party, serving in Louisiana State Senate (1866-1870) and the United States House of Representative (1875-1885). He also held the position of chairman of the Committee on Mississippi Levees and was a key figure in the Wormley House Conference that helped resolve the disputed election of 1876 in Louisiana. After leaving Congress, he resumed the practice of law in Washington, D.C., where he died April 25, 1889.</note>

This portion of the volume is entitled A Retrospect (p. 1-72), wherein he describes his political views; the development of Confederate military forces; his military service; battles in Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee; and his capture at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Ellis wrote the account while imprisoned at Johnson Island Prison in Ohio. It serves as an introduction to his prison diary, which begins February 1, 1865. In the diary, Ellis documents his daily observations and experiences as a prisoner of war.  During his imprisonment, he read a great deal, and his entries exhibit an extensive knowledge of history and an appreciation of poetry. Additionally, his personal thoughts reflect his grief and distress over the war. Pages 118-132 contain poems by and autographs of other prisoners.  Page 131 also contains a list of men killed and where.

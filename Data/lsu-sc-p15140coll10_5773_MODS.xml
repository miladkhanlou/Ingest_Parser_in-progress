  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Henry Vignaud, born in New Orleans, La., was a newspaper editor before the Civil War. Commissioned a captain in the 6th Louisiana Regiment, he was taken prisoner when Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 but escaped to Paris, where he assisted in John Slidell's Confederate mission. Vignaud contined to live in Paris, serving as secretary of the American legation from 1875 until his retirement in 1909. A scholar and book collector, Vignaud built an extensive library of Americana and gained an international reputation as an historian for his work on Christopher Columbus."
Eugène Dumez, journalist, was born in St. Juste, France, and participated in the French Revolution of 1848, emigrating shortly thereafter to Louisiana, where he worked as a publisher and editor of the French-language newspapers Le Meschacb and L'Avant-coureur.</note>

He states that the South had a chance for success in the foundation of a Mexican empire and that the unpopularity of the French expedition to Mexico would increase if the undertaking were linked to recognizing the Confederacy.  He believes that recourse to European liberals rather than to Maximilian and the Pope would have been more beneficial.  Dumez mentions Supervielle, Malespine, Aucaigne, the Opinion, Chatard, the Presse, Boulet, Rameau, and the Mmorial.  He requests copies of the Autographe, the Revue Nouvelle, and the Loterie.

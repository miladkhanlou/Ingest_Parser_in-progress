  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Henry Vignaud, born in New Orleans, La., was a newspaper editor before the Civil War. Commissioned a captain in the 6th Louisiana Regiment, he was taken prisoner when Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 but escaped to Paris, where he assisted in John Slidell's Confederate mission. Vignaud contined to live in Paris, serving as secretary of the American legation from 1875 until his retirement in 1909. A scholar and book collector, Vignaud built an extensive library of Americana and gained an international reputation as an historian for his work on Christopher Columbus."
Eugène Dumez, journalist, was born in St. Juste, France, and participated in the French Revolution of 1848, emigrating shortly thereafter to Louisiana, where he worked as a publisher and editor of the French-language newspapers Le Meschacb and L'Avant-coureur.</note>

Dumez states that the Mmorial will flourish along with the Mexican empire and comments on the empires future as well as on Maximilian.  He gives detailed plans for future reorganization of the Renaissance, drawing from contemporary literature and journalism, and announces a resurrection of the Estafette.  He pinpoints Lefrancs, Lamulonires, and Vignauds roles in these endeavors.  Dumez mentions including the works of Alexandre Barde and Jean-Sylvain Gentil in the Renaissance.  He refers to a manuscript by Barde on Marceaus niece, an elderly woman who supposedly died in the Attakapas region.  He mentions connections to Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat, Chol, and Bossange and offers ways to research Louisiana history.  Dumez states reading reports favorable to the Confederacy in the Sicle.  He relates plans to visit the Slidells and encourages the recipients seeing Rost, Rameau at 45 Rue de la Victoire, and A. Callaud for the sake of Lieutenant Lefort of the Catinat.  Dumez mentions Malespine and Aucaigne.  He conveys Lefrancs relating that Lamulonire has been distilling rum in Pointe Coupee, probably at Parlanges, and offers his opinion of the journalist.

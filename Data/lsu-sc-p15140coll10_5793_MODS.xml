  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Henry Vignaud, born in New Orleans, La., was a newspaper editor before the Civil War. Commissioned a captain in the 6th Louisiana Regiment, he was taken prisoner when Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 but escaped to Paris, where he assisted in John Slidell's Confederate mission. Vignaud contined to live in Paris, serving as secretary of the American legation from 1875 until his retirement in 1909. A scholar and book collector, Vignaud built an extensive library of Americana and gained an international reputation as an historian for his work on Christopher Columbus."
Eugène Dumez, journalist, was born in St. Juste, France, and participated in the French Revolution of 1848, emigrating shortly thereafter to Louisiana, where he worked as a publisher and editor of the French-language newspapers Le Meschacb and L'Avant-coureur.</note>

On the route, we pass\nthrough Opelousas, Grand Coiitcau, Vermilion-\nvillc, St. Martinsville, New Iberia, Franklin, Cen-\ntreville and Pattersonville. The parishes interested in this part of the Road, are. St. Landry,\nCalcsftieu, Lafayette, \\ ermilion, St. Martin and\nSt. Mary's. A portion of the parish of Rapides,\non Bayou Bceuf and Bayou Robert, will use this\nroad when completed, and on which the principal\nsugar plantations of that parish arc found.\nOutside of the State of Kentucky, so beautiful\na country I have never seen as is this whole line ;\nand I was filled with astonishment at finding such\n'a region in the State of Louisiana, but which\nexplained itself ou finding it completely cut off,\nas it is, from direct communication with the\nMississippi river and New Orleans, by swamps,\ntrembling prairies, lakes and tortuous bayous.

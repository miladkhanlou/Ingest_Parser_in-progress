Its fertility\nis equal to that of the best lands in Louisiana,\nas its productive statistics will show. This land\ngenerally is what may be called rolling prairie,\ninterspersed in many parts with timber. All the\nwater courses are densely timbered. The land,\nthough described as rolling, is nevertheless what\nmost persons would say is a strictly level country,\nand not an acre but may be cultivated.

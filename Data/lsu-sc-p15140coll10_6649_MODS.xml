Now, Lafayette,\nVermilion and St. Landry, comprising what is\ncalled the \"Opelousas country,\" and lying above\nthe Attakapas, and having further to go to market;\nand although not producing so much sugar, yet\nthey more than make up that deficit by their\ncotton, beef cattle, &amp;c, and consequently their\nexpenses would be equally great, if not greater,\nthan those of Attakapas. But taking it as only\nthe same, say 1295,000, we have the sum of\n590,000 as the present business of the Attakapas\nand Opelousas, and which is only the upper half\nof the road. The cost of making the whole road\nis estimated at $10,000 per mile, or about\n$1,600,000 for the whole road. Now, let us see\nwhat would be the profit on this half of the road.\nThe cost of maintaining the road and running the\ncars on the Georgia railroads per annum is $39}\nper cent, of their gross receipts; those of New\nYork 39J; those of Massachusetts 39:], and the\naverage of the latter, for the past seven years, is\n40a per cent. Now, to take 40 per cent, off\n$590,000, (the business of Attakapas and Opelousas, and from their peculiar situation, it would\nhave to come by this road) would leave $354,000\nas the profit on this half of the road, being equal\nto 22 per cent, on $1,600,000, the whole cost of the\n\u25a0road! Nor is this all. By the present mode of\ngetting their produce to market, these planters\nare subjected to expenses of cooperage and great\nloss from drainage of the sugar, from its having\nto be rolled so much in loading and unloading, and\nof insurance, which is equal to sixty cents to each","fullrs":{},"find":"2056.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2055","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"551209","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.53 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

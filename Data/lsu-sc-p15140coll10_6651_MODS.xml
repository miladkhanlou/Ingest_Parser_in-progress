These calculations are\nbased on the actual statistics the past year. But\nwhen we remark that the section of Louisiana\nthrough which this road is contemplated to run,\ncomprises 23,000 square miles, equal in size to\nthree such States as Massachusetts, and that not\none-fifth of its finest lands are now in cultivation,\nfor want of such an outlet as this road is designed\nto furnish; and not one-tenth of the land that can\nbe cultivated, if the road is made, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the stock of this road will\nbe the best in the United States.

In proof of this latter, let a few facts suffice.\nMassachusetts commenced making railroads in\n1834. In the year 1840, the total value of all the\nproperty in the State, as returned to the Auditor's\noffice for that year, amounted to $299,878,329.\n[n 1849, when she hud nearly a thousand miles of\nrailroad completed, the value of her property had\nincreased to $590,531,889, showing an increase in\nnine years of $290,653,560, and  for which she","fullrs":{},"find":"2058.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2057","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"544385","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.52 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

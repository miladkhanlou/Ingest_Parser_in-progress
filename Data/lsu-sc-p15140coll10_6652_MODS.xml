No commercial excitement, nor\nextravagant speculative fever has happened to her,\nmore than to any other State in the Union, in\nthat time; nor has any local cause stimulated this\nvast increase. It is not her manufactures, for as\nman&gt; factories have, perhaps, gone out of existence, or suspended, as there have been new ones to\nsupply their places within that period. The value\nimparted to property, in the towns and counties\n(for the same period) through which these roads\nrun, is $156,000,000 over what it was in 1840,\nleaving $134,653,560 as the general indirect power\nof railroads to impart value to property in the\nState, contiguous to, but through which they do\nnot run. In Georgia, lands that in 1846 could be\nreadily bought for twenty-live and fifty cents per\nacre, now, that her railroads have developed\nthem, command ten, twelve and fifteen dollars per\nacre. In point of fertility, those lands bear no\ncomparison to the lands through which this road\nis designed to run. From a map of this section of\nour State, from Algiers to Opelousas, made by the\nSurveyor General, designating all the swamp and\noverflowed lands it contains, it appears there arc\nover 11,000,000 of acres of land, of which only\n373,000 acres arc marked as swamp or overflowed\nlands, leaving more than 13,000,000 of acres of\ncultivatable lands. If Georgia, by her railroads,\nin four years, was enabled to impart an additional\nvalue to her inferior soil of ten or twelve dollars\nper acre, can it be doubted that an equal or","fullrs":{},"find":"2059.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2058","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"508669","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.49 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

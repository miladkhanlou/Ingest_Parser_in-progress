The subject\nwhich assembles you together is one of great importance, not only to the city, but to the state ol\nLouisiana and the whole Southwest. I trust, gentlemen, in view of its importance, that you have come\nhere to act, act, act! A few months ago I had the\nhonor to be a member of a Convention which assembled at Memphis, for the purpose of constructing a\nrailroad from the valley of the Mississippi to the\nPacific ocean. That road has not yet been started,\nand this state and city have now au opportunity of\nlaying the first rails of this great road, by carrying\nthrough the great enterprise which it is the object\nof this Convention to further and promote. Let us\nthen, gentlemen, cooperate in this great enterprise\nwith ardor, enthusiasm, and determination. Let us,\ntoo, after having performed the duties for which we\nare convened, go homo to our constituents and urge\nthorn to action on this subject. Let us bestow our\nvotes on no candidates for office, who arc not committed in favor ot this enterprise. Gentlemen, 1\ntrust your proceedings will be harmonious and satisfactory.\nM. M. Cohen then offered the following  resolutions :\nResolved, That a railroad shall be built from New Oilcans\n*o Washington, in the parish of St. Landry.\n2","fullrs":{},"find":"2074.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2073","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"469581","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.45 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

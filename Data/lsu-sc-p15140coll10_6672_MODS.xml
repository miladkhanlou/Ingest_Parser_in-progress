With these estimates and surveys\nthe company can go to work immediately.\nThe 5th resolution proposes, \"that they shall take steps tl\nprocure such legislation as may be required in ihe preinises.'\nThis refers more particularly to the obvious defects or in.\nadequacy of our present corporation law. It is impossible\nto construct a road of this magnitude in Louisiana, as the!\nlaw now stands. Its formalities are too minute-\u2014its rel\nstrictions too many, and some of its requirements inexpedi-l\nent. I state, as an instance of this last, that it requires 2(1\nper cent, to be paid in cash at the time of subscription. Now\nthis per centage on one and a half million of dollars, would!\nbe $300,000. This is a much larger sum than would bel\nneeded at that time. But I will not enumerate all the impel!\nfections of our existing corporation law. May it suffice \u25a0\nstate that, I had occasion to examine them as a member ol\nanother permanent committee, chosen by the citizens of NeM\nOrleans, for another road; and so convinced were we of till\nutter impracticability of any successful organization, under!\nthe present corporation laws, that memorials, praying for a\u00bb\nextra session of the legislature, were unanimously signed\nand a committee sent up to Baton Rouge to present them to\nthe Governor, and a spokesman was chosen by the committee, and he made an excellent address to his Excellency.

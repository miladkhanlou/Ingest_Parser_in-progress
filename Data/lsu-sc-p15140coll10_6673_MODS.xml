But I never\nheard that the Governor had granted the prayer of the memorialists : although I would be as likely to hear of it as any\nbody else, for I happened to be chairman of that committee.\nBut as we have received no answer, and as silence gives consent, I still indulge in the pleasing hope that the Governor\nwill call an extra session in December, which can run into\nthe regular session, This will give the legislature three\nmonth's session ; whereas, otherwise, they could sit but for\nsixty days.\nThe sixth resolution provides that the committee shall\nframe a provisional act of incorporation, and apply to the\npolice jury of each parish and to the municipal authorities in\nNew Orleans for such sums as may be needed to defray the\nexpenses contemplated by the fourth resolution.

The only difficult!\nand costly bridge on the whole route will bo across the Lai\nfourche, and that, in my opinion, will cost less than several\nof the bridges on the proposed New Orleans and Jacksoi\nRailroad.

Taking Mr. Phelps' estimate of the cost ol\nthe latter named railroad, as a guide, I have no hesitation hi\nsaying that the road can be constructed within the estimate]\nThe Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, in Ohio, con\n$8,000 per mile ; the Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad, il\nMissisippi, cost #8,600 per mile, and the Wilmington and\nRaleigh Railroad, in North Carolina, cost $10,778 per mild\naccording to the American Almanac of 1849.\nWe were told that if the country planters, through whicbl\nthe road will run, would take one-half the stock, or there]\nabouts, that the balance would be taken in NewOrleans.-l\nTwo modes of raising the necessary amount in the count\u2122\nparishes have been suggested\u2014one by private subscription]\nto which there can be no objection. Many persons think thai\na sufficient amount cannot be raised in that way.

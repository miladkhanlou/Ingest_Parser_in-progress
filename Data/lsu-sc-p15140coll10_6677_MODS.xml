It will no doubt meet withiopposition, but those who\nproposed the measure, think that when the subject is properly understood, objections will, in a measure, cease. To\ncarry this mode into operation, a law will br* required to authorize the planters to subscribe and issue bonds, indeed, the\nwhole scheme will have to be referred to the Legislature, to\nobtain the right of way and authorize so large a capital to\nbe invested in a corporation; the existing laws authorize neither.

And a vote\nof the people of the town of Providence has lately been taken\non the question, whether or not that town should subscribe\nlive hundred thousand dollars to the stock of a railroad to\nrun from that town to Fishkill, and decided, in the affirmative,\nby a vote of nearly three to one.\nhave been making some calculations, and in order to show","fullrs":{},"find":"2084.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2083","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"499071","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.48 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

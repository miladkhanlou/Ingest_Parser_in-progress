But when I remember that that call has emanated, principally from my associates, on this floor from St.\nLandry ; and that they expect, through me, to make known\nto this convention, some of the views of tho particular re-\ntrion of country they represent, I am emboldened to discharge the duty they thus devolve upon me.\nThis convention, gentlemen, constitutes an era in the history of, Louisiana. Impressed with the great importance of\ndeveloping the resources of our own state, and of enhancing\nthe prosperity of our own great metropolis ; we have assembled lo confer together, as to the best means of accomplishing these desirable results. The scheme in which we have\nembarked, is not merely a local one. It does not seek the\naggrandizement of any particular parish, or region, at the\nexpense of any other section of the state. It deserves the\nsympathy and support of every citizen of Louisiana. As\nan evidence that we of the country parishes are alive to the\nimportance of opening a direct communication between New\nOrleans and Southwestern Louisiana, I have but to point to\nthe numerous and respectable delegations now before me.\nAnd so far as the parish of St. Landry is concerned, I take\ngreat pride in pointing to her representatives on this floor,\nwho have turned out one hundred strong, to pledge their\nparish, its wealth, its energy, its influence, to the completion\nol the New Orleans, Algiers, Attakapas and Opelousas Rail\nhoad. Such a body of men never before left that parish at\nany one time, or on'any one occasion. Other parishes, though\nnot so numerously, are ably and efficiently represented. And\nit augurs well for the success of our undertaking, that, fired\nwith enthusiasm, and determined to shake off the trammels\nwith which they have been fettered, they have met you in\n4","fullrs":{},"find":"2090.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2089","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"509653","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.49 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

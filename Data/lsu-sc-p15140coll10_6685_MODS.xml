To say nothing of the region\nsouth of Berwick's Bay, of which I know nothing from personal observation, the parishes of Opelousas and Attakapas\nalone, when propel]y developed by this new communication,\nwill, by their increased commerce wi.h New Orleans, and\ntheir heavy shipments to and from your city, be the means\nof paving more than a handsome dividend on the capital\nstock ol' the road. How much vacant land remains to be\nbrought into cultivation in these pari-bes, I am not now able\nto sav. But you may form some idea on the subject, when I\ntell you that there are in the parish of St. Landry alone\nabout one million and a half acres of laud, nearly all of which\nis susceptible of cultivation, and most admirably adapted lo\nthe production of sugar. Of this, less than two hundred thousand acres are now cultivated. Immense forests and piai-\nries are yet unredeemed from their primeval condition, by the\nindustry of man; and, although this parish was one of the\nfirst settled m the state, it is but sparsely populated, and agriculture yet in its very infancy. But the exuberant fertility\nol the soil compensates for the want of the appliances of art\nto its tillage : and the husbandman, with the smallest application of agricultural skill, is rewarded annually with a plentiful harvest. And this may serve as a criterion for the remaining parishes, as far as Berwick's Bay. They are all\nadapted to the growth of our staple products ; and, under\nthe prospering influences of the railroad, will constitute the\nmost wealthy, populous and productive region in Louisiana.\nGentlemen, it would be doing injustice to this beautiful portion of your state, to leave unnoticed its striking geographies features, and its salubrious climate. And were I painter\nor poet, I would endeavor to give you a faint idea of its\npicturesque scenery, its evergreen groves, its splendid forests,","fullrs":{},"find":"2092.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2091","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"513183","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.49 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

It was a happy idea of yours, Mr. President, that\nthe first bar of irln which would be laid upon the track at\nAlgiers, would be followed up continuously by others, which\nwould terminate only on the shores of the Pacific ocean.\u2014\nThe march of empire and of public improvement, bend their\ncourse alike towards the setting sun. And in a few years,\nthe same genius which has suspended bridges over the falls\nof Niagara, and communicated with a vocabulary snatched\nfrom the lightning, will send its long and pompous train over\nthe iron highway, that shall terminate only on the shores of\nthe Pacific. I believe, gentlemen, as I believe in your existence and in mine, that 'it is in our power, with the cooperation of Texas, to give shape and direction to this great\nenterprise. We may advance with it so far, that its completion to California will be secured\u2014not by Louisiana, not by\nTexas\u2014but by the urgent demands and the united will of the\npeople of the entire Union. We shall then occupy a central\npoint, in the great commercial highway of the world. The\ncommerce of the East Indies\u2014the commerce which has been\ncherished by nations through all time\u2014will flow through our\nborders, and impart more than eastern wealth and splendor\ntu this great emporium of the valley of the Mississippi. The\nwealthy productions and the gorgeous fabrics of the Indies,\n\u2014which contributed thousands of years ago to the magnificence and grandeur of Babylon, and Nincvah, and Palmyra,\nand Carthage\u2014will be daily landed upon our wharves and\nreceived by our princely merchants. Throngs of citizens\nfrom iar distant shores, will daily crowd our streets, bringing\nwith them the language, the customs, the wealth, of those\nenchanted regions, watered by streams\n\" Whose foam is amber and whose sands are gold.\"\n5","fullrs":{},"find":"2098.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2097","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"487253","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.46 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

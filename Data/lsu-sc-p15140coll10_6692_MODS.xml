Long lines of floating palaces, will attest the general!\nprosperity; and the dense forests of masts, stretching in]\nlength, with the increase of population, will characterize I\nNew Orleans as one of the proudest commercial cities in\nthe world.\nBut, Mr. President and gentlemen, in pursuing this vision\nof-the future glory of the capital of my native slate, I find\nthat I have consumed more of your time than I had intended.    Let Rie conclude by saying that we have been too long!\nindifferent to the improvement of our country, and the dcvc-i\nlopmcnt  of its  vast resources.   Let us participate less in]\nsectional and political agitations, and embark  energetically\nin those public improvements, without which we can never]\nbecome a great and prosperous state.    The fame which,\ngreat leaders and statesmen have left behind them, has been!\nmeasured, not so much by the mere triumphs of intellect, or]\nsplendid achievements on the field of battle, as by the benc-j\nfitfthey have conferred on society, in promoting works of'\ngreilt practical utility.    When the glories of Austerlitz and!\nMarengo shall have been forgotten, the name  of Napoleon!\nwill be associated  in undying lustre, with the great public!\nworks which his genius and his energy promotcel in France. I\nAnd if Americans can  ever forget to associate the name of]\nWashington   with  the  battle-fields of  the  revolution; bisl\nchief glory vvill be derived from his ardor,  in promoting the 1\npeaceful  development of the  country, whose freedom bad\nbeen purchased  by his sword.    Let us, also, by our united I\nexertions,  command the homage  of those that are to follow j\nus, by constructing a work of great public utility, which will j\nbe our proudest monument hereafter.\nOn motion of E.

It was highly impoj\ntant that our present enterprise should be associate\nwith the grand movements in favor of railroads j\nthe southwest.\nCharles N. Olivier, of St. Mary, referred, in vigdl\nous and warm terms, to the necessity and practicj\nbility of this route. He was born in Attakapas, al\nhad lived in the country ever since\u2014knew every pari\nof it, and could bear witness to its immense adval\ntages. This road was bound to be built. If Nej\nOrleans did not do it, it would be prosecuted ant\ncompleted by the energy of the people in the country. He did not wish to bully New Orleans, I\nshe ought to see the immense interest she has\nstake in the matter.\nMr. Gates, of St. Landry, made a few rcuiarn\ndisclaiming any sentiment hostile to New Orleans,!\nany such purpose as that of creating a post at Bl\nmick's Bay, or elsewhere. They were determined\nto adhere to NgK Orleans, and they expected N\u00ab\nOrleans to stand by them.    (Loud applause.)\nCol. High thought that the convention was gettijj\noff the track. They had come here to build a roj\nto Opelousas, but they were now for straying off in!\nTexas and elsewhere. He trusted that the objcctl\nthe convention would be first disposed of, and to th*1\nend he would pledge the parish of Jefferson.","fullrs":{},"find":"2105.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2104","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"529508","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.50 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

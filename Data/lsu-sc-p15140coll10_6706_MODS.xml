In 1847, the southern exports\nwere $102,000,000, against the northern $48.000,000; in 1848,\n$98,000,000, against the northern $34,000,000 ; in 1849, $99,000,000,\nagainst $32,000,000.* These facts are conclusive in evidence, that\nthe rail-road inferiority of the southern states is not the result of inferiority in commercial and transportable commodities and wealth.\nA comparison of particular states will show, too, most conclusively,\nthat not the mere denseness of population has influenced rail-road\nconstruction. Thus Ohio is denser than the average of New-England,\nand has but one-third to one-half the extent of rail-roads. Indiana,\nand parts of Michigan, are as dense as Vermont. Kentucky and Tennessee both exceed the density of Maine, which has nearly 211 miles\nactually constructed, whilst Kentucky and Tennessee together have\nnot so much ; or, to compare even the southern Atlantic states with\neach other, Georgia, with one million of papulation, has twice or three\ntimes the extent of rail-roads contained in all the states of the Southwest, and South Carolina has more than Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi,\nAlabama and Arkansas, actually constructed, though her population\nis not one-third so great as theirs !\nWill it be said that the people of New-England and the North are\nmore migratory in their habits, more extensively addicted to travel,\nthan the people of the South and the West ? This may be true, but\nfor no necessary reason, as the statistics of the Georgia and Carolina\nroads already evince; and, indeed, the experience of the North itself\nconfirms our judgment. Time was when locomotion was as tardy\nand as interrupted at the North as it is here, and the disposition for\ntravel did not then exist.\nWhen the Boston and Lowell road was proposed, the commissioners,\nbasing their estimates upon the extent of travel then existing, supposed that 37,500 passengers might be carried annually. This high\nfigure was thought by many absurd. Ten years afterwards this road\ncarried 400,886 passengers in the same time. The Boston and\nWorcester road was estimated at 23,500 passengers; in 1846 it\nreached 470,319. The Eastern road claimed 121,000; it has reached nearly one million ! The Fitchburg road, based upon the results\nup to 1845, had calculated upon 72,000 passengers per annum. The\nnumber immediately reached 327,034. Thus the traveling propensities of Massachusetts did not create their roads, but the roads\ncreated these propensities.!\n* See De Bow's Monthly Commercial Review, Vol. X., p. 153.\nt Safety of Rail-roads.\u2014The chief cause of the popularity of rail-roads asjnatrumenta\nof travel, is their safety.

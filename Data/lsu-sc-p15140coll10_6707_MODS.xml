In a republican government more than\nin any other in the world, these arguments should be held irresistible\nand conclusive in favor of such speedy, cheap, and uninterrupted\ncommunication.\nIt is curious to reflect upon the tardy progress which the world\nhas made in the means of transport and conveyance, until within the\nexperience of the present generation of men. Only eighty years\nago, in proud old England, the traveler, Arthur Young, bewailed the\n\" perils\" of her best turnpikes. \" Let me most seriously caution all\ntravelers who may accidentally propose to travel this terrible country,\nto avoid it as they would the devil, for a thousand to one, they break\ntheir necks or their limbs by overthrows or breakings down.\" \" This\nis a paved road infamously bad ; any person would imagine the\npeople of the country had made it with a view to immediate destruction, for the breadth is only sufficient for one carriage ; consequently it\nvale carriages. There were in operation, January 1st, 1849, in Massachusetts, and the\nadjoining states, 1,259 miles of rail-road ; and in 1848, (as far as reported) there were\ntransported on these roads 19,474,203 passengers within six years; there were 22 passengers killed\u201453 employers, and 42 other persons\u2014iu all, 117. In England it is estimated that the chances of a man's losing his life in traveling 300 miles, is as 217,879 to 1;\nand that out of 400,000 packages of merchandise only 1 is lost. By a return made to the\nEnglish Legislature, we find a statement made of accidents which had occurred in England, Ireland and Scotland, for half a year. Ninety persons had been killed ; of these,\nthirteen died from causes which the parties deceased could not have averted. Fifty-\nseven had died from misconduct or carelessness on the part of the deceased themselves.\nNinety-nine had also been wounded; and the whole number of passengers had been,\nduring the half year, no fewer than 26,330,492 persons. These facts illustrate very fully\nthe safety of this mode uf travel.\"\n*\u2022 For dangers, etc., of river travel, see Appendix to this Address.\n* See Appendix in Illustration.","fullrs":{},"find":"2114.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2113","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"585152","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.56 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

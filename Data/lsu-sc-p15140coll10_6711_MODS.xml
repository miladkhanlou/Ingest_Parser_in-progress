Proprietors, urban and rural, feel their effects primarily and to\nthe largest extent. If the whole amount of the investment were forever without dividend, it would be good economy often for the landholders if they contributed every cent of it. The enhancement of\nthe value of property has in many cases paid tenfold the value of the\ninvestment. Throughout the Union property has received an actual\ntangible benefit to a much greater amount than the cost o^ **\" Lfle\nroads in it. New-York is a strong illustration.

These are not speculative views, but realities. The\nappreciation of property in Boston from the roads converging upon\nthat city has been estimated at thirty-seven millions of dollars. A\nreference to the statistics of Carolina roads will show, that property\nand trade has, within the last fifteen years, and since the completion\nof our rail-roads, increased in a greater degree on the Neck, in Colleton, Barnwell, Orangeburg and Edgefield, than in any other portion\nof the state,\" &amp;c.\nHe says again : \" 1 shall show that trade has expanded, and the\nvalue of real estate increased, since the establishment of the rail-road.\nAny one who will make the inquiry, will find that land all along the\nroad to Hamburgh and Columbia for five miles each side of it, has\nappreciated in value since its construction, 50, 500, and in some\ncases, 5,000 per cent., and where before its construction there were\nnot twenty thousand dollars of trade, there is now upwards of\n$250,000. The valuation of property on the South Carolina Railroad, compared before and since its construction, shows\u20141830,\n$11,337,012; 1846, $19,075,157: gain, $7,638,145. The city of\nCharleston shows real estate, 1830, $8,366,914; 1840, $13,527,743 :\ngain, $5,160,829. This increase in trade, and the value of real estate,\nI insist has been principally attributable to the introduction of rail\nroads; and if the saving were added to the gain, the advantages would\nappear almost inappreciable.\"\nThe statistics of New-York and Boston are even more interesting\nin showing the results of rail-roads.\nBOSTON.\nReal Estate.

The cost of freight from Butfalo to New-York before the construction of these canals, was $100 per ton. The canal committee\nsupposed it might be reduced to $10 or $12, whereas, in fact, the\naverage of freight from Buffalo to New-York from 1830 to 1850 was\n18 81, and in the last three years it has been reduced to $7 50 per\nton 364 miles. The return rates are higher. With the enlargement\nproposed, freights will again be reduced one-half. Charles Ellet, Esq.,\nengineer on the Virginia Public Works, estimates the freights on canals, exclusive of tolls, 1^ cents per ton per mile; on rail-roads, %\\\ncents; McAdam roads, 15 cents; turnpikes, 15to 20 cents; steamboats on the lakes, 2 to 4 cents; on the Mississippi and Ohio, \\ to\nl\u00a3, or an average of f to 1 cent.\nIf there were wanting other considerations to induce the people of\nthe South-west to enter upon the construction of a system of railroads, extending through every part of their limits, it would be easy\nto find them in the peculiar position which they sustain with relation\nto the rest of the world. They have an interest in each others' prosperity, founded upon common hopes, and fears, and dangers. Menaced,\nas they are, from so many quarters, it becomes them, in every possible\nway, to strengthen themselves at home. The interests of Mobile,\nNew-Orleans, Charleston, or Savannah, in each other^ advancement,\nare stronger than their interest in the advancement of Boston or New-\nYork. These interests should preclude all jealousies and rivalries,\nand induce a generous co-operation in every instance where the benefit of the whole South is at issue. Such a course cannot be in conflict\nwith the individual interests of any. By opening or creating new\navenues of trade and production, and extending our operations at home\nand abroad, it is possible for these cities, and all others in our midst,\nto go on enlarging, and increasing, and extending their influences,\nwithout at all affecting the progress of each other. In so wide a field\nthere will be room for all. The progress of Boston has not destroyed\nNew-York, but has rather diverted her energies into new and profitable\nchannels. It was an idea of the Middle Ages, as barbarous as it was\nfalse, that one community could only advance at the expense of\nanother.    The benefits of trade are reciprocal.\nIt is not true, that we at the South are deficient altogether in the\nspirit of progress and improvement, and can only be fed by the labors\nof our fellows. The South has had triumphs enough to satisfy us\nthat the principle of progress is here, though latent for the moment,\nand that it only requires the proper stimulant to be brought into an\nactivity which shall know no rest. She had at one time the longest\nrail-road in the world, and was the first to project a rail-road across\n-ne mountains to the banks of the Ohio; an enterprise considered, at\nthtLtime, the most stupendous in the world*\nIhe West, too, full of youth and vigor, has a high destiny before\n1851        Cilarleaton and Hamburg and Louisville Road.\u2014De Bow's Review, February,","fullrs":{},"find":"2123.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2122","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"514602","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.49 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

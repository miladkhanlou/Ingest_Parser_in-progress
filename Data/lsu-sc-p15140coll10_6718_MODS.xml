There is yet another great advantage possessed by\nthe Southern and Western roads so far as cost is concerned, in tho\ncircumstance that wood, which is an important expense in the item of\npropelling the ears at the East, is found in great abundance throughout the greater part of the new country ; and from the level character\nof the soil tho tracks of the rail-roads may be run in direct lines from\npoint to point. The soil of these sections of the territory is very\nmellow, so that the expense of excavation will be comparatively small.\"\nThe principle laid down in the following remarks may be assumed\nto be correct, not only for New-Orleans but for any other city, and\nshould underlay any system of works which may be commenced in\nthe South-west.\n\" The sum of the commerce of a seaboard city is regulated by the\nnumber and extent of the interior cities representing its several tributary\nbasins; to draw off the tribute of one of those cities or basins is lo diminish the\ncommerce of the original outlet by a corresponding amount.\u2014If the Chattanooga\nRail-road draw off the business of Nashville to Charleston, the commerce of\nNew-Orleans is diminished by an amount corresponding to the trade of the Nashville basin. On the other hand, to extend the area tributary to one of her interior\ncities\u2014to increase its production or stimulate its industry, is a gain lo that amount\nto the business of the sea-board city. For example, to extend the area tributary to\nthe city of Natchez or to the city of Memphis, is a gain to the amount of the\nextension by the city of New-Orleans.\"#\nIt thus occurs that the interests of the sea-board city are as much\nsubserved by the interior rail-roads as if their terminii were actually\nat its wharves, and that a sound policy will not be satisfied with\ncontributions only to roads having such a terminus. It is possible to\nreceive more actual benefit from a road 100 or even 500 miles away,\nthan from another whose locomotive smokes in our suburbs.\n\u25a0there are three classes of roads, whose discussion belongs to the\npresent occasion, and which we shall briefly pass in review, with such\nstatistical details and information as will enable the reader to form\naccurate idea of the enterprises, present and prospective, of the\nnuth-west and the West, whether of a character tending to the advancement of their own cities, or those of other sections of the\nUnion. \u2022\ntu i    J*6-^\u2122' class WU1 be embraced the roads in the states of Ken-\nand I     \u2022\u2122essee&gt; Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas,\nLouisiana, as forming a system in which New-Orleans, in parti-\nar, Ans a primary and paramount interest.\nIllino the S-C\u00b0\"[Z c'ass is included the roads of 0hi\u00b0.

These roads are\u2014The Mobile and oji\nRoad; The Selma and Tennessee Road; The Blakely and Giroti\nor Georyia Road.\nAnd first of the Mobile and Ohio Rail-road: This road has a total\nlength of 521.8 miles, and is estimated to cost $9,700,000.

An appropriation of one million acres of\npublic domain has been made to the company, of sufficient value, it\nis thought, to iron the entire line,  and furnish  it with ample equip.\nments for a large through business.    In Mississippi the Boards of'\nPolice have been authorized by law to subscribe to the extent of\n$100,000 each,  to  the road, after obtaining the vote of the people. .\nThe county of Noxubee was the first to act under tho law by an over-1\nwhelming majority.    A portion of the iron has been contracted for, |\ndeliverable at Mobile, for $38 per ton, T pattern, of 65 lbs.   Til\nprinciples of the Mississippi act, allowing the counties to subscribe ia i\na corporate capacity, extends to all rail-roads which  may he under- |\ntaken in the state, and admits of the issue of county warrants at 12\nmonths, bearing interest to meet the subscription.\nThe total population upon the line of the Mobile and Ohio Roa\u00bb\nis estimated at 725,322.    It is argued for the road,\n1. That the planters on tho route, from the difficulties of river navigation, are kept back two months from market, and pay from 83 5t|\nto $7 transportation on a bale of cotton, whilst tho rail-road will\nfurnish it for $2 50 to $3 50; that com will be delivered to these\nplanters from Tennessee, for 25 cents, against 50 and 75 cents \u25a0\npresent, and bacon at half the present rates, and so of other article*\nof consumption. ,\n2. The corn, wheat, hemp and tobacco growers of Tennessee an\nKentucky, will be furnished with a steady and uninterrupted niarke ,\nthe iron miners of Central and Western Tennessee will enjoy\nsame facilities; and the 100,000 bales of the Tennessee Eher cotWH\nwhich now takes a voyage of 1300 miles to a market.\n3. That the road will enjoy much of the transport of passengra\nand merchandise, now passing from New-Orleans  to the O'110'\ndownwards, by 250 steamers, averaging 75 passengers, and 400 t\nor in all, 375,000 passengers, and 2,000,000 tons freight annually- I","fullrs":{},"find":"2130.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2129","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"626088","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.60 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

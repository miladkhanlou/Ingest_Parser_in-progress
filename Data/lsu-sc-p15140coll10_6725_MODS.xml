The road intersects an abuu.\ndant mineral and rich agricultural country in the greater portion of\nits extent, and the chief engineer says :\n\" It is a link in the great chain of rail-roads now constructed  and projected j\non the most direct, shortest and most expeditious route which can   be selected, I\nto connect the Gulf of Mexico with the middle and the  North-eastern Atlantic\nStates; a route which will present one continuous line  of mil-roads, passing\nthrough the most healthy and picturesque sections of the Union.\n\" This great chain of rail-roads may be said to commence at Portland, in thi\nstate of Maine, thence to extend to Boston, New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,\nand to Winchester, Virginia ; up to this town the line of rail-roads, with short '\ngaps of steamboat travel, is now completed ; thence to Staunton and to Abingdon,\nthrough the great valley of Virginia, and on to Knoxville, Tennessee, a part ot'the\nroute is under contract. From Knoxville to the Georgia Rail-roads, the connection\nby rail-way will soon be completed. From the Georgia roads the connection\nwith your rail-road, either from Rome or Chattanooga, will naturally follow the\ncompletion of your enterprise ; indeed.it may be anticipated, charters having\nbeen obtained at the last sessions of the Legislatures of Georgia and Alabama,\nfor a rail-road from Jacksonville, in Benton county, to Rome, or to some point\nfarther south on the Georgia State Road, as may be found most practicable^^\nThe third great road is that from Blakely, on the Bay of MobiM\nto Girard, opposite Columbus, Georgia, on the Chattahoochie River.\nLength of the road 238 miles, or perhaps 230.

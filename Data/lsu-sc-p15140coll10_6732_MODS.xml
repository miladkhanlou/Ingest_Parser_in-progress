She must, by a wise\nn*d liberal stroke of policy, regain a part, if not the whole, of the\ntrade she has supinely lost, and open new sources of opulence and\noower which are abundant all around her. She can do this by changing and modifying her laws bearing unequally or hardly upon, capital\nand enterprise ; by cheapening her system of government; by affording\nareater facilities and presenting less restrictions to commerce; by establishing manufactures, opening steamship lines to Europe, and conducting aforeign import trade; and finally, and what is of first importance, and should precede every other effort, by munificent appropriations TO RAIL-ROADS BRANCHING TO THE WEST, AND THE NOETn,\nAND THE EAST, FROM A TERMINUS AT HEU CENTRE, OR FROM TERMINI   ON    SUCH    INTERIOR    STREAMS   AND   RIVERS   AS   ARE   NECESSARILY\ntributary to HER. Now is the accepted time for action. To-morrow will be too late !\nThe concern of this committee is, however, entirely at present,\nwith rail-roads; and having discussed, with some elaboration, the\nvarious routes connecting the South, tho East, and the West, their\nduties will be performed by a reference to the routes now in projection in Louisiana, with tho view of connecting her with her neighbor\nstates, and more particularly with the great lines of public works\nradiating through every section of the Union.    These routes are\u2014\n1. The New-Orleans and Jackson [Mississippi) Bail-road, with an\nultimate destination to Holly Springs, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the\nOhio river.\n2. The New-Orleans and Opelousas Hail-road, with ail ultimate\ndestination in Texas, New Mexico, and as far westward as tho de-\nniands of population or of industry may warrant.\n1. And, first, of the New-Orleans and Jackson Eail-road.   This\nroad has been advocated in Louisiana and Mississippi upon grounds\nwhich entitle it to tho highest favor, and several conventions have\nbeen held for promoting its construction.    A most favorable charter\nr been procured in Mississippi, authorizing the counties on the lino\no subscribe  for stock  by taxation;   and  a similar  charter,   it is\nglit, will bo obtained  from the Legislature of Louisiana, which\n\u2122ots'\"January next.

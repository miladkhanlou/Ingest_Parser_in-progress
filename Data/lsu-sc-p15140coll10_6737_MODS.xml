Though lemporariiv suspended by the difficulties interposed\non the part of Mexico, the work should not be allowed to rest, but every effort, consistent with peace and goodwill towards Mexico, should be brought in requisition to carry it\nthrough. The road will, practically, make the Gulf of Mexico and the cities upon itthe\nbasis of future operations in the Pacific, until some overland communication through the\ncontinent has been achieved.\nThe Florida Peninsula road is also one of great interest, and should be properly represented in the proposed Convention. In Florida it has been advocated with much\nzeal, and a citizen of that state, (Mr. Fairbanks.) in VeBows Review, connects it inseparably with the Tehuantepec.    We give an extract:\u2014\n\" The Tehuantepec route is 135 (160 or 170) miles in length, and  is  as practicable, M\nfar as cost and time  of construction i3 concerned,   as that to Panama.    The advantage\noffered by the Tehuantepec route, to compensate for its increased length, is the saving of\nsea distances from  each direction to its termini on the GuW and Pacific, being 1,200mile*\nnorth of Panama.    This saving in sea distance is estimated at 1,700 miles, in making the\ntrip from New-Orleans to San Francisco;   the distances being stated at 5,000 miles from\nNew-Orleans lo  San Francisco, by way of Panama, and as being only 3,300 by *'\u00bbJ\nof Tehuantepec;   and being  from New-York  to San Francisco, by  way of   Panama\n5.858 miles, and by way of Tehuantepec only 4,744 miles\u2014being   a saving, by Tchuan-\ntepee,  of 1,100 miles.    This immense difference in the sea distances, other things boUj\nequal, would seem to be conclusive in favor of the Tehuantepec route.    But, by tlie \"\"\"J:\nstruction, in connection with this Tehuantepec route, of a rail-road across the P?'\"ns\"ifl\nFlorida, a still greater saving of sea distance would be made in the distance from \"Ne\nYork.    These two projects of constructing rail-roads across the  Isthmus of Tehu3ntePr\nof 135 miles, and saving 1,700 miles in   the passage to San Francisco, and  a^ros,9   j\nPeninsula of Florida 135 miles, and saving 1,000 miles in the passage to NewYorK\nEurope, would be achievements in the progress of communication, worthy of the ?P'     _\nthe age, and of the consideration of the people of New-Orleans and the Memphis\nvention.    These connections made, and you will Bee that New-Orleans would heconi^^\ngreatcentre of trade and commerce of a continent.   Without the Tehuantepec route 1\nOrleans is left far to the northward  of the great stream of trade and commerce ^      .\ntoward the Pacific.    Without the rail-road across the Peninsula of Florida, the s\nships connecting between New-York and Tehuantepec or Panama, will be co'iipe\nleave her to the northward, or lose several hundred miles; while, with bo  ,       Lsth\u00ab\nconstructed, (and the Florida route is estimated at less than 81,000,000,) she bec\u00b0   ,jffe0\ngreat central point of the  commerce of two oceans.    Tt is a magnificent idea to     ^\nupon, that, by the construction of 270 miles of rail-road, New-Yorkand San Francis   ^\nDrought within 4,300 miles of each other, and New-Orleans within3,000 miles; \"\\eettie&amp;\nting off nearly 10,000 miles of the voyage round Cape Horn.    And-it will not be    .   ggn\nan extravagant supposition,  that, when constructed, 20  days will suffice  to rea\nFrancisco trom New York, and 16 days from New-Orleans.","fullrs":{},"find":"2144.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2143","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"633431","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.60 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

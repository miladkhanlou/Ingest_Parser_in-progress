The great outlet and market for Texas is New-Orleans M\nthis road to strike her centre on the east, (as all her rivers are small and uunavigable mo'st Jl\nyear, except in great floods of rain,) her Legislature will, doubtless, direct her gramj jiflB\nment to meet this one from New-Orleans.\nThe Practicably ofthe flout*..\u2014Washington, the proposed present terminus of the rorf*\nsituated in the parish of St. Landry, on the west bank of the Cotirt-a-bleau, on a l&gt;eautiM\u00bb\ntcau of land, about thirty feet above the highest high water level of the Mississippi ftjver 'J*\nthis point the same plateau of land is continued down as far as Berwick's Hay, a distance wfl\nofthe road, of eighty-five miles, but gently dipping until it reaches the latter point. n'h\u00ab*fl\nelevation ofthe land is not more than ten or twelve feet ttbove the high water level ofthe !nW\nsippi River. On the route we pass through Opelousas, Grand Coutcau, Vermiiionville. gi I\nlinsville, New Iberia, Franklin, Centrevitle and Patersonville. The parishes in teres 7 \u2022'\npart of the road are St. Landry, Calcasieu, Lafayette, Vermilion, St. Martin and St. _,,\nportion of the parish of Rapides, on Bayou Bceuf and Bayou Robert, will use this roarj wu\ncompleted, and on which the principal sugar plantations of that parish are found.\nOutside ofthe Stato of Kentucky, so beautiful a country I have never seen as is thistthafefl\nuid I was filled with astonishment at finding such a region in the State of Louisiana, bus ^\\,J\nexplained itself oil (in,ling it completely cut off, as it it, from direct communication with then\ntissippi River and New-Orleans, by swamps, trembling prairies, lakes and tortuous bavoi\nis, from its southern exposure to the sea-breeze, perhaps the most healthy portion of the i\ncan continent. By the census of 1S40, it appears there are more centenarians in this particfl\nlection than in any State in the Union. Its fertility is equal to that of ihe best lands in LoajS\ncna, as its productive statistics will show. This land generally is what may be called rollingnfl\nlie, interspersed in many parts with timber. All the water courses are densely timbered. ifl\nhnd, though described as rolling, is nevertheless, what most persons would say, ai * *\ncountry, and not an acre but may he cultivated. Prom Opelousas to St. Martinsvi . .\n\u00bbill pass and develope what is known as the \"Cote Gelly Hills\" country, lc is mostly DnJH\nbut is said to be their very richest lands, and to the eye it certainly presents the most magqj^H\nscene man ever looked upon. But a small portion of it is cultivated at present, owiDgtofl\ndifficulty of obtaining, conveniently, timber for necessary fanning purposes, but which wifl\nwholly relieved by the proposed road.\nIf unsurpassed health and fertility of soil be any elements on which to feed a rail-road ton\nness, and to which, add its equally unsurpassed loveliness, with so great a commercial martai^H\nOrleans for its terminus, then of all countries or sections this presents considerations to caail\nists no where else equaled on this continent for safe investment of money.   The Tech\npits out of the Bayou Court-a-bleau, some twelve miles below Washington, is abeautifulitrtjl\nand takes the same general course of the road, which, nt some places,  it approaches, whilijS\nothers it is several miles from it.   Berwick's Bay is a sheet of water some 700 yards in wioM\nwith a rise and fall of about two feet throughout the year.    This it is proposed to cross ill bMfll\nsuitable for the transport ofthe cars.    The land on this (the lower) side is also high, and theijj\nwill pass directly to the Bayou Black country, in the parish of Terrebonne, along which it tjj\npass for some eight to fifteen miles above Tigerville, offering an outlet for the country on &lt;**M\nside, and passing thence direct towards the Lafourche, developing the Terrebonne, Cai!lou,^H\nlarge, &amp;c., aud crossing the same at or near Thibodeauxville.  From this point two routes PN^J\nthemselves\u2014one going to the Mississippi River by the upper side of Lake Des Allemanoa^M\nthe other towards the lower or right side ofthe lake, and directly towards the city, approBfflM\nthe river at the entrance of the Barrataria Canal, and so on to the main depot iu Algierr\nofOrletns.   Beiwiek'sBay is about half way between New-Orleans and Washington, &lt;\neighty-one miles from the city by the way of the road.   This will give a distance of o\ndred aiic sixty-six miles.    On the upper half there are two or three small bayous, and the\nlion to bridge, all of which are small, with high banks.   On the lower side of Berwick's ft\nthe exception ofthe Bayou Lafourche, the bridging will be about the same, perhaps the\nlie two ii ore bridges on the lower half (of small size, however), wanted, more than on theijMH\nhalf ofthe road.    On the whole route no swamp of greater difficulty occurs than is n0*\"3|\nby the Ftntchartrain Rail-Road to the lake.    But little grading or filling will be required Wra\nthe mereditchingof the road, as the  land is level, generally,\"as could be desired.   The MJSM\nroute, (hcrefore, is practicable, aud perhaps presents fewer obstacles to overcome than 'jj'^H\nroad of ecual extent to be found anywhere.    The cost of making will not exceed ten thoi^\ndollars per mile.\nGP Published by the Convention Commiltee on Rail-Roads in Be Bow's Mj&gt; J|J\nReview.

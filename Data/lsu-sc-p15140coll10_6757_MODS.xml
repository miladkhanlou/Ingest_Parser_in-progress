He regretted that this report must be verbal, for, as is wefl known to\nmany of them, and particularly to his esteemed friends, the Secretary, Mr.\nFlanders, and Col. Payne, that he (Mr- C.) had devoted to the service of\nthe road so much of that leisure which he could snatch from the pressing duties\nof an arduous profession, that he had not time left to write out the report.\nOrally, he would state that, on the 5th of June last, this Convention appointed\na Permanent Committee to procure surveys, the necessary legislation, and the\nmeans of defraying preliminary expenses. The Permanent Committee\nassembled on the 5th of June, and appointed a Special Committee to procure\nsuch legislation as might be needed, and an Executive Committee at New\nOrleans, to carry out the duties of the Permanent Committee during\nthe recess.\nThe first named of these two Committees, to-wit: the Special Committee*\nof -which he had the honor to be Chairman, have, with great pains, prepared an elaborate draft of an Act to provide for the organization of corporations: also, a Memorial to the Legislature, &amp;c; an Act to authorize subscriptions to the road, and provide for the payment thereof. This pamphlet, he\nsaid, was now in the hands of all the members of said Special Committee for\nexamination and revision. He handed in a copy to be preserved among the\nrecords of this Convention.\nMr. Cohen, in continuation, said that the second of these Committees, viz :\nthe Executive, addressed memorials to the Parochial and Municipal Authorities\nw grants of money, proportionate to their interest in the road, and afterwards\nsent their ever-prompt, able and faithful agent, Mr. B. H. Payne, into the\n^untry to collect the appropriations-\nSubsequently, he and other gentlemen were appointed by the Executive\nCommittee as Delegates to the Burkeville Convention, called by the friends of\nth\u00ab road in St. Landry.\nhe Executive Committee', appreciating the wisdom of the steps taken by\n. Cltizens of St. Landry, and the importance of establishing intimate relations\n-Lexas, seconded and supported it to the extent of their ability and influ-\n\u25a0    The objects of that Convention were fully accomplished, and Texas and\nmsiana there engaged to carry forward, in unison and harmony, those great\neasures destined to produce incalculable advantages to both States.    The\naT&gt;Ks of the Committee were tendered to their Delegates, for the faithful\ne**ution of their trust.","fullrs":{},"find":"2164.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2163","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"582594","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.56 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

The Coa..-\nmittee's opinion of the distinguished ability wherewith he accomplished hjgj\nmission, would best appear from the fact, that, on his return, the thanks ofthft\nCoinmittce were publicly tendered to him, and his Address ordered to be pule\nlished in all the city papers. Mr. C. handed in a copy of Mr. Paynb'j\nAddress, and referred to him for a more detailed account of his delicate\nmission.\nMr. Cohen stated that this Committee also established an office, where the\nmaps, books and papers referring to this road, and railroad documents generally,\nwere collected, and where the friends of this enterprise might repair U\ninformation.\nThe meetings of the Committee were held on Monday of each week, since\n-Juno last, at that office ; and it was designed as part of a system of bureaus\nto be established throughout the Parishes, and the germ of a more extended\norganization.\nThe proceedings of the Convention in June last, which gave form and\nvitality to the entcrprize, had been printed in pamphlet form, and distributed\nas widely as possible.\nThe Executive Committee also requested their Secretary, Mr. B. F.\nFlanders, to prepare an abstract of the Committee's proceedings, and forward\nthe same to the members of the Permanent Committee, in pamphlet form-\nThis he accomplished promptly and well. Mr. C. handed in a copy of saial\nabstract, which, he said, brought our proceedings down to the 8th day \u00ab\nDecember last.\nWith regard to surveys, owing to causes which are explained in the abstract,\nand which were beyond the control of the Committee, they were unable to\nplace Surveyors in the field until the first week of December.\nTo insure the completion, before the 2nd day of January, of the survey\nfrom New Orleans to Berwick's Bay, two surveying parties were set to w&lt;&amp;*\non different sections. It was the opinion of the Committee, which w*3\nconcurred in by Judge Moore, who happened to be here on his way to\nWashington, that the only portion of the contemplated line to Opelousas, \u00bb\nwhich there was any uncertainty as to feasibility or cost, was that lying between\nthe Mississippi river and Berwick's Bay, and that the necessary omission of *\nsurvey beyond the latter point, would, under the circumstances, cause A\ndissatisfaction","fullrs":{},"find":"2165.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2164","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"614904","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.59 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

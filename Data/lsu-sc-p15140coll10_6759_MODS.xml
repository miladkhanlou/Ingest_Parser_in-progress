Blanciiard had prepared a Report,!\nwhich was printed for use, but from the greater length of his line, and other causes\nexplained by him, lie had not had time to have his sketch of the road lithographed.\nThe Committee, fearing that Maj. Blanciiard would not have time to make\nan actual survey of all the lines of his section; requested Messrs. Flanders\nand Seger to examine the proposed line south of Lake Des Allcmands, as far\nas Bayou Des Allemands. The result of their examination is most cheering,\nas will appear from their Report,*}: which was handed in.\nMr. B.

But, now, he congratu-\n1 es them, and all, that recent developements in Texas and elsewhere have\na so numerous and enthusiastic, that the prolongation of the road is now\ngarded by all as probable, and by many as certain.\nt   \u00b0\u00b0d and sufficient cause had he, then, to felicitate them on the proud\nJe on which, at this day, their prospects repose ; not tremulously, but\nely and triumphantly.

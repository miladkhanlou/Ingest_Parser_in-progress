A feeling n\nwidely diffused, and so active, must leave an indellible impression-^,\nimpression which might be changed in the future, but could not fe\nobliterated.\nHe saw assnmbled and assembling the philanthropist, the professional mail,\nand the agriculturist, and commerce, mighty commerce, was sending its representatives. It was obvious that the overwhelming importance of establishing\na railroad system was appreciated\u2014a system throughout the whole State; and,\nmoreover, the necessity of building their own Opelousas road was recognized\nThe only remedy for the evils under which the State and the city suffered mi\na railroad system. This conclusion was the offspring of experience, that lint'\nand plummet of the human mind. The speaker deprecated strongly opposition\nto internal improvement. The most obdurate that had to be encountered, is\nhis opinion, was that springing from a supposed interest in opposition. TH\ngrew out of an apprehension that the towns and villages on she western road\nwould be ruined by the construction of the road. This wras an objection that\ncould not be removed, for it was the objection of selfishness. But it might ha\nsuggested to tnose people, that were the Opelousas road complete, the population of New Orleans, during the summer months, would be scattered over the\ncountry; no more tempting invitation could be presented than the magnificent\ncountry, the beautiful scenery, and the salubrious climate on the Opeloosag\nroute.\nWild lands now sell there at five dollars an acre, five hundred miles distant\nas they are, by the circuitous navigation; but what would their value be, it\nbrought within five hours of New Orleans ? What more tempting field to tin\nenterprising and speculative ? Was New Orleans so oblivious of her be\u00a3\ninterests\u2014so lost to her duties to herself, as not to reach forth her hand and\narrest her departing glory? What a glorious position was hers ! Half ^\nbetween Europe and Asia; tho heart of the world; on the centre of the In\"\nover which the pendulum of commerce oscillated !\nThe people in St. Mary had come to the conclusion that railroads were\nindispensable, and had also concluded that the only system by which they cou\u00bb\nbe built was by taxation, [applause] and the friends of that principle stood prepared for the issue. IS defeated, the shame would be their glory. But *\u2022\nword fail was not in ther vocabulary, and all they wanted was that Ne\"\nOrleane should contribute her share to tho work.\nThe Convention then adjourned, to meet, in pursuant\nof previous resolution, in the Lyceum Hall, at noon, &lt;\"\u00bb\nMonday, and join the Southwestern Convention.","fullrs":{},"find":"2177.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2176","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"604140","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.58 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

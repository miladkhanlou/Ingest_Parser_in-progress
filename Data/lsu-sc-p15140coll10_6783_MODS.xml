An issue of corporate bonds in instalments to suit ft.\nprogress of any proposed work can be protected by a capitation and property ta\nequivalent to the running interest on the bonds issued, with an excess to operate ai i\nsinking fund ; and this current interest may be charged to construction account, juj\nrepresentative scrip delivered to those who pay the tax. Bonds protected by such t\nprovision can be converted into money by a sale to planters who may prefer such a\ninvestment to direct subscription; or planters, through whose domains the propose\nRailroad may run, may willingly construct ihe earth work, and receive their coin\nsation in such bonds at par. Or contractors may take_a portion of their contract prices\nin the same medium.\nIt is thus that, with the subscriptions of local corporations and private individuals,\nmoney may be raised for the purchase of iron, rolling stock, and other purposes, fa\nwhich it is indispensable. But much must be done by interesting and instructing the\nplanting interest in the construction of Railroads. Engineers and those engaged ii\ngetting up the stock of a road should explain the extreme simplicity of its structure.\nThere is really no more science in making a railroad when the work has been laid of\nand calculated for construction, than there is in the culture of any staple crop whatever; while to those who are familiar with the construction of a levee, nothing i\nis necessary than the addition of a rail to constitue the embankment of a railway. U\nthe subject be stripped of all mystiness, and it will be seen that the son or brother of\nthe planter can hire hands, purchase implements, build shantees ; and, with ordinary\ncapacity for superintendences, make a railroad to as much advantage as a prac\ncontractor could do. It will be, moreover, found'from the example of Virginia and Got*\ngia, that slave labor is cheaper than free labor\u2014that it is much more efficient in\u00bb\nwarm climate\u2014that it is more reliable when tried by the year than periodical law\ncan be\u2014that it is far more tractable: and, not being liable to strikes and riots, is (ooa\nacceptable to the community in which it is employed. If, therefore, planters can \u00ab\ninduced to engage in the construction of such sections of railroad as lie within then\nestates, they will often take a portion of the whole amount of their contract in stoct-\nbecause it is an investment of surplus labor and provisions in a work that affords the*5\nthe means of transporting their produce to market\u2014a facility which w'ould often .p\"'\nfy the construction, if attended by no other compensation whatsoever. But the pi*\nferred employment of the local labor and superintendence, gives also a popularity a\npolitical influence to railroads which does not result from the employment of t\u00b0xa$\nlabor and superintendence; and when the citizens of a county or vicinage have\nnished mules, provisions, superintendence or labor, there is a substantial benefit, tro\nexpending and retaining the whole cost of construction amongst the community wtu\nhas contributed, that render a proposition of subscription and taxation much more poF\nlar than under a different system it would be.\nThe influences of this Convention will, it is hoped, contribute to restore confiden\nthe destinies and in the enterprises of the South-west. The only emulation w*uC ^\ncounsels consists in the noble strife of making our natural resources contribute to\npermanence of the Union, by demonstrating that its protection is indispensal**\ngeneral and sectional development; and that internal improvement, with its inevj\nincidents of wealth, population and political power, will constitute the most e\nSouthern system for establishing the unity and equality ofthe States.","fullrs":{},"find":"2190.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2189","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"616288","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.59 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

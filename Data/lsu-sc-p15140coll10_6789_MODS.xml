Crossing this swamp \u00bb\na distance of about a half mile, the line enters upon the high lands of Bayou Boeuf agia.\nThence the line passes over said high land, mostly in cultivation, crossing Bayou Raraosm\ndistance from Lafourche of 22\u00a3 miles nearly, and reaches Berwick's Bay at a distance of 3(1\nmiles from Thibodaux, of which, say 5\u00a3 miles is through levee overflowed swamp land, a. \u25a0\nthe balance on high, level and arable alluvial lands.\nOn this route there will be required several culverts across small bayous and drains, i\u00ab\ninvolving heavy expenditure; and in addition, five bridges\u2014viz.: two across Bayou Tipt,\nwhich is GO feet wide and 8 feet deep ; one across the draining bayou in the swamp betwsa\nBayou L'Ours and Bayou Boeuf, which is 150 feet wide, and from 1 to 3 feet deep ; one at\nBayou Boeuf, the cross section of which is given above; and one across Bayou Ramos, whid\nis 360 feet wide, and G feet deep.\nThe country traversed on this route is very nearly level, no portion being more than 15,\nnor less than 2 feet above tide water. Consequently, no cuttings will be required; no\nbankments, except in the swamp portions, sufficient to elevate the road above the higheM\ncrevasse water, and in other portions to secure a good foundation.\nAbout one half of the whole length of the route is on arable land, never overflowed, andlii\nother half on land subject to immersion from 1 to 4 feet, in times of extreme high water of the\nMississippi river, caused by breaks of the levee in the parishes of Point Coupee and Vest\nBaton Rouge. It might be supposed that an embankment, such as it is proposed to matt\nwould operate as a dam, causing injury to the lands above it, as well as to the work it*\"*\nSuch would not be the case, because the great area over which this crevasse water extendi,\nand the level surface of the country in all directions\u2014mostly a dense forest\u2014gives to theort-\nflow more the nature of a lake than that of freshet inundation. The culverts and bridges pi*\nposed on the route will be amply sufficient to allow the water to maintain nearly the same le\"1\non each side ofthe embankments.\nI am in possession of data sufficient to estimate closely on every portion of the road betwef\nThibodaux and  Berwick's  Bay, with exception only of the bridges.    The  time allowed W\nmaking the survey was not sufficient to permit me to bore or sound the bottoms of the bay** I\nrequiring  bridges,  and  consequently only an opinion can be hazarded as to their descripf**\nor cost.\nMany engineers and others are of opinion that the best manner of building railroads act\noverflowed swamps similar to those on this line, is on a construction of tressel work. 1 c\u00b0^\nceive that a more substantial and cheaper road-bed can be obtained by throwing up solid\nbankments of earth, and I have estimated accordingly, giving them such a height in\nswamps as to be more than one foot above the highest crevasse water-marks, and on \u2022\nland so high as to secure at all times a solid foundation-\nESTIMATES.\nCutting trees and clearing roadway,  --._.. $8,600\nAll embankments and grading,  36,890\nLumber for mud sills and cross ties, --,... 32,020\nIron rails 63 lbs. per lineal yard, spikes and chairs,         -        - 112,750\nLabor on superstructure,    ----....- 32,100\nAdd 10 per cent, for contingent expenses and engineer's department,   22,236\nTotal (equal to $9,144 per mile,)  244,596","fullrs":{},"find":"2196.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2195","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"563986","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.54 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

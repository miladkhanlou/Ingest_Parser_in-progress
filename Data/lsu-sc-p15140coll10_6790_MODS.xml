Time has not allowed me to make this survey, as ordered in your instructions, and toprepare a report thereon in season to be submitted to you previous to the meeting\nof the convention.\nThe distance between Thibodaux and Berwick's Bay, by the route last described, would be\nbetween 38 and 40 miles. From previous knowledge of some portion of it, and a recent examination, without instruments, of other portions, I am of opinion that the route, (with the\nexception of one particularlocality of the extent of about 2 miles), is entirely practicable, but\nwould cost as much, or more per mile, than the more direct route, first described, and which is\nsome 12 miles less in distance.\nThe question then would present itself whether the additional local business of the longer\nroute would justify the outlay of its additional first cost of construction, and also the additional\ncharge on all the business of the r oad from and beyond Berwick's Bay, in all future time.   On\ntne longer route many more curves would be^required^than on the other, consequently less\nvelocity in transit could be obtained with  the same degree of safety.    Those only who are\npractically acquainted with the working of Railaoads will give due weight to this comparison.\nAnother thing to be considered, and one I think of much importance, is, that the longer\nroute, terminating at Bayou Shaver, would forever preclude the propostion of crossing Berwick i Bay, on a permanent bridge   Most persons, I am aware, are of opinion that it is not prac-\n'caole to do so.   In order to satisfy myself, and others who may be inclined to investigate the\n\"\"iter, though not required by your instructions, I have taken a cross section of the Bay,\nwve the mouth of Bayou Boeuf, the result of which is shown on the annexed sketch.    This\n'8s dearly to my mind that if the bottom shall be found sufficiently firm, a permanent\ngecan and certainly will be constructed across the Bay, sooner or later, if the road shall\nave any considerable extent or business.    At first it may probably be advisable to cross\n\u25a0 w'ck s Bay by means of a floating bridge, and if it be so decided, then the road should be\n' near 'he Bay, as represented on the annexed sketch by dotted lines, in order to avoid a\nu^ \"at on the eastern shore of the Bay.\nthe fractions also required me to survey the route for a branch from the main road to\nll \"      \"ouma) in the Parish of Terrebonne.    I have projected on the sketch, in dotted\nvat A aitterent routes, either of which may be selected. The shortest follows over cultivated 1 S \u00b0n y\u00b0u Terrebonne, being in length about 15 miles; and the other over culti-\nWonH JJ?'' m\u00b0Stly' on Bay\u00b0u Black&gt; having&gt; length of about 17 miles.

These importers and the warehousing system\n^ reCovering back to the South a portion of the direct trade. The\nduties collected at Charleston this year are greater than they have\never been; and Charleston imports largely of Havana cigars for\nNew-York.\nIt is true that the quantity of produce coming to New-Orleans in\nsearch of a market, has fallen off; and, consequently, the number\nof vessels arriving and departing, has decreased. This is what has\nalarmed, and justly alarmed, the people of New-Orleans. The cry\nis \"what's the matter % Here, there is decline, where there ought\nto be robust, vigorous health; depletion, where we ought to look for\nhabits plethoric and full. What is it that has brought our city to\nthis state of decline'?\" It appears to me that a satisfactory answer\nto this question is a necessary preliminary to the treatment of the\ncase\u2014to the application of remedies.\nIt is in the domestic trade, I apprehend, that the great falling off\nhas taken place ; or rather, I should say, it is in the export trade by\nsea, whether domestic or foreign, and not in the imports by sea,\nwhere the decline is; and if a decline in the quantity of produce\ngoing out of the mouth of the Mississippi has taken place, why, of\ncourse, a decline in the quantity delivered at New-Orleans from the\nupper country has preceded.\nTo satisfy myself as to the correctness of these views with regard\nto the import trade of the Mississippi River, I called upon the commissioner of customs, who has obligingly furnished me with the following tabular statement of the gross revenue collected at New-\nOrleans, &amp;c., for the last five years :\u2014\nGOVERNMENT   RECEIPTS   TOR   CUSTOMS.\nNew-Orleans.

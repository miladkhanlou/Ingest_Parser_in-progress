It will never\ndo to let Great Britain, or any other power, command that sheet of\nwater with her ships of war.\nTo whom shall its defences be entrusted, but to us of the South\nand West, who have so much at stake there 1 It is well known that\nwe will fight hard for our cotton bags.\nTherefore, fortify the Tortugas, and build up the navy-yard at\nMemphis. The South and the West have been thimble-rigged out\nof that navy-yard. The law made it a naval depot, or dock-yard. It\nhas been converted into a rope-walk, and thereby it has become a\nby-word and a reproach, if not an eyesore to its friends.\nI repeat here what I have recently had occasion officially to\nupon the same subject :\n\"The enterprise of American citizens is about to open one or more\ncommercial highways across the Isthmus. The access to them lies\nthrough American waters. They will be the channels of communication between the distant shores of the nation\u2014its great highways\nfrom one part of the Union to the other.\n\" The faith ofthe nation has been pledged, touching the neutrality of\nsome of these communications. The country will expect its navy\nto keep them open in war, and to preserve unsullied the national\nfaith.\n\" The way to these thoroughfares, and the road to market from the\nMississippi valley, run side by side through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"No system of measures for providing for the common defence can\nbe considered either complete or effective, unless it secure the command to us of this mare clausum. Its commercial importance,\nalready great, will, in a few years more, be paramount.\n''Already the natural outlet for millions, it is destined to surpass all\npther arms of the sea for its commerce, its wealth, and its national\n'fflportance.\nl Ihe currents and winds at sea are such as to unite, in the Florida\n'&amp;W, the commercial mouth of the Amazon with that of the Mississippi.\n., *\",e market-way across the seas, from the valley of the Amazon,\n1 Orinoko, the Magdalena, the Atrato, the Coatzacoalcos, the Rio\n[\"ande, and the Mississippi, passes through or upon the borders of\ncom 8 are ProJected which will turn in that direction the\ntnerce of the East; and all the ships engaged in it, whether from\nheanS6 \u00b0r Ameriea- wil1 sail through the Gulf of Mexico and Carib-\nu rj?ea' Passing by our doors both coming and going.\nquii    '0U\u00a7h the ^ulf of Mexico anii Caribbean Sea, the country re-\nchaiT' Sa*\"\u00b0 con^uct hi war f\u00b0r *ts mails, its citizens, and their mer-\nothe       ^ ^J* Pass t0 an(* *\"ro from one Part \u00b0^the Un*011 to the","fullrs":{},"find":"2237.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2236","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"524909","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.50 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

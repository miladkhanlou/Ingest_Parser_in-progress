Unless we avail ourselves of these resources,\nit will be difficult and expensive to command it in war.\nTherefore, in providing a system of national defences for our in-\nterests in that quarter, one ofthe first steps is to complete the navy-\nyard at Memphis, and make of it an establishment worthy of its\nobjects, and capable of giving force and effect, in time of war, to the\nimmense naval resources, power and strength of the great valley ofthe\nWest.\nTo Memphis, Pensacola, and the fortifications at Key West and\nTortugas, ought to be mainly entrusted the defences of the Gulf of\nMexico.\nIt has been said, \" It is too expensive to build a navy-yard at\nMemphis: piles will have to be driven at the edge of the river;\"\nyet it is not too expensive to drive them in the bottom of the sea at\nNew-York, and build there a dock, which the Secretary of the Navy,\nin his last annual report, tells the country has cost $2,146,255.\nI do not comprehend the logic which makes it too expensive to\nprovide for the common defences in the Gulf of Mexico, the roost\nvital part in our whole system, when it has been by no means too\nexpensive to provide defences for the Atlantic. Provide as effectually,\nor as ineffectually, we care not which, for the common defence of the\nGulf as for that of the Atlantic. All we want is justice, even-\nhanded, impartial justice.\nAccording to the Report of the Secretary of War, just presented\nto Congress, on the subject of fortifications, the amount expended upon\nthe army and navy, exclusive of dock yards, in providing for the coin-\nmon defence since 1816, has amounted to upwards of seventy-ny\nmillions of dollars. How much of this has been expended upon g1\"\ndefences, or for the benefit of the people whom I address % Precio\"\nlittle. We all know the Atlantic states have enjoyed a double benefit : 1st, of having the works in them ; and secondly, of drawing *\nmoney for them from the South and West, and spending it &gt;n \"^\nNorth and East.\nTo me, gentlemen, it is immaterial whether a proper n3va.)MS\ntablishment at Memphis will cost one or twenty millions of dol\nto found it.

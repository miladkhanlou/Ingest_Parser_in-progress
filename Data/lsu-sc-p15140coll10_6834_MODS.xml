It is peculiar.\nHe reports fine sugar and coffee plantations there, with cotton\ngrowing wild ; also, there are cinnamon groves, and forests of the\ntree from which the Peruvian bark, which affords quinine and physic\nto the world, is taken ; and being put on the back of these sheep and\nasses, is transported from the head navigable waters of the Amazon,\n600 miles, among the clouds and snow-capped mountain-ranges, to\nthe Pacific.\nIt now goes west, and when it arrives at the seaport town of\nArica, it is worth, annually, half a million. With the right to send\nan American steamboat up the Amazon, all this stuff would come\neast and flow down that river.\nWith the free navigation ofthe Amazon, a steamer might load at\not.

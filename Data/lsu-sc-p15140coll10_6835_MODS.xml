Legions of benefits and advantages areto\nflow from it; many of them are palpable and obvious; some are dim\nin the mists of the future ; but all of them are certain. In short as\na commercial matter, the free navigation of the Amazon is the ques.\ntion of the age. As time and use shall develop its bearings, our\nchildren will weigh the effects upon the prosperity of the country\nofthe free navigation of the Amazon with the acquisition of Louisiana. They will place them in the balance together to contrast and\ncompare them; and on considering the effects of each, they will dis-\npute and wrangle as to which of the two has proved the greater\nblessing to their country.\nI inclose, herewith, a pamphlet, entitled \" Commercial Conventions\n\u2014Direct Trade, &amp;c,\" in which the subject of steam communications\nwith the mouth of the Amazon, but no further, is treated.\nThe question which I propose for the especial consideration of the\nConvention, relates to the free navigation, of the Amazon itself\u2014\nto the right of the people of the Llnited States to send their steamboats to that river, to ply up and down it, as they do upon the waters\nof their own Mississippi, and to buy, sell, and get gain on the banks\nthereof.\nCommerce, so far as climate and soil are concerned in ministering\nto its wants and in imparting health and activity to its influences, is\nbased upon an exchange of the produce of one latitude for the produce of another, and for this simple reason: that the planter who\ngrows sugar in Louisiana, does not wish to exchange it for Brazil or\nany other sugar. He may exchange it for Brazil coffee, or for Brazil\nanything else that is not sugar.\nFor this reason, Europe, for hundreds of years past, has been struggling for the commerce \" of the East;\" and for no other reason, than\nthat latitudes and climates, and consequently wants and Pro^u?j\nthat are not to be found or satisfied in Europe, abound in uw*\nEast.\"\nIn a commercial sense, the valleys that are drained by the \"fathe*\nof waters,\" and the \"king of rivers,\" as the Amazon is called, *ffi\ncomplements of each other.

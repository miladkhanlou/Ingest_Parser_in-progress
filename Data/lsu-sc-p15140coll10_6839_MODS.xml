There\nshe sits, contentedly enthroned upon the great Delta of the Missis.\nsippi, an appropriate representative of Fortune, while the god of\nrivers pours into her lap the treasures of his immense dominions.\nMobile, on the \"other hand, not so bountifully endowed, and possessing much more limited resources, was naturally the first to feel the\neffects of that successful rivalry, which limited them still more, and\nwas consequently the first to institute a great chain of improvement,\nconnecting with the gulf the waters of the northern lakes; thus\ndemonstrating that there is an awakened energy in our own region,\nwhich will at least make a determined effort in the right direction.\nIt gives me sincere pleasure, while upon this subject, to say, what\nI have no doubt the Convention will be pleased to learn, that recent\nevents, not necessary here to be detailed, have removed the last doubt\nas to the completion of that great work in which our citizens have\ntaken so active a part; and that in perhaps less than a twelvemonth,\nthe entire road from Mobile to Lake Michigan will be placed vnif\ncontract.\nAs between these cities, this should excite no jealousy ; the kindly\nfeeling which has characterized their past intercourse, should be stu\nfurther strengthened by this great work, with which both should he\nidentified. In the struggle for commercial ascendency, which is daily\nbecoming more and more severe, New-Orleans and Mobile stand W\ngether against the mighty efforts of the Atlantic ports to seize upon\nthe commerce which geographically belong to the gulf cities.\nIt is in this point of view that I regard this great road, traversing\nso many degrees of latitude, and embracing such a variety of P'\nducts, as the first great counter-move in favor of the gulf, securing\nher cities an immense traffic, which would otherwise find an outl\nupon the Atlantic.    Its magnitude can only be estimated by &lt;*^\nsidering what in a few years must be the population of the valley\nthe Mississippi. Who that has the slightest appreciation of thefutuw\nwill deny that the gulf, the natural outlet of so much of i's v\nproductions, will rear upon its borders two cities of the first maj&gt; ^\ntude 1  Their proximity, surely, constitutes no valid objection-\nmuch less than that of New-York and Philadelphia; and *e","fullrs":{},"find":"2246.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2245","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"565489","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.54 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

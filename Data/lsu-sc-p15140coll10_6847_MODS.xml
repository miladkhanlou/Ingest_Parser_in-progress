But the argument of my friend is, I think, in a cagp\nlike this pushed to an extreme; and, in my opinion, the whole commerce\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific may bo monopolized and commanded by\na moderate freight charge, making it vastly the cheaper o^ any route.\nIt is considered a good passage from New-York to San Francisco, by\nCape Horn, if it occupy no more than 5 months, or 150 days. Now, by'thg\nrail-road route, as exhibited in my letter of the 24th September, 1849 a\npassenger train would move over this distance, at a rate of 20 miles the\nhour, in 11 days; and to San Diego in 8 days. At 15 miles the hour it\nwould require to San Francisco, 13 days; to San Diego, 10 days. And at\nthe slow rate of 10 miles the hour, the time to reach San Francisco would\nbe 17 days; to San Diego, 14 days.\nTake any of these rates, and compare them with the 150 clays ofthe\nusual sea voyage, and the difference is so vastly in favor of the road,'as to\nensure to it the monopoly of the whole trade. The point then to be guarded against is, not to destroy this decided and important advantage in time\nby an exorbitant freight charge.\nSuppose, then, that no higher freight were charged on the road, than is\ncharged on the sea-voyage ; then, the moneyed charge would be the same on\nthe road as on the sea-voyage, and all the diftbrcwe of time would be\ngained by the shipper, a difference so vastly in his favor, that it must prevent all shipments by sea, and insure the whole trade to the road; and\nnot only is there this difference in time in favor of the road, but the difference of interest upon the freight saved by time to the shipper, which would\nfrequently be more than equivalent to the road-freight charge, and make\nthe rail-road tantamount to a free road.\nThese considerations fulfil all the conditions of my friend's reasoning, in\nreference to the advantages of a free road, and yet justify a charge for\nwear, tear, and repairs, and for freight trains.\nThe average shipping freight charge is $25* the tun. which, on 150,000\ntuns, would yield $3,750,000.\nBy the passenger trade we have $10,500,000\nAnd by the freight, as above,     3,750,000\nMaking a total of $14,250,000\nBut the income required to insure 6 per cent- upon the stock (after paying all annual expenses) is $10,200,000: we have therefore from these two\nconsiderations (passengers and freight) an excess ol' four millions, winch\nwould justify a reduction of the charge per passenger to $100 each; ot\u00bb\nwill justify a serious reduction of our supposition in reference to amount \u00ab\nfreight trade. Respectfully,\nJ. J\". Abert,\nCol Corps. T. M\nHon. V. E. Howard,\nHouse of Representatives.\n' With very fast sailing vesse high as $40 the tun has been paid.","fullrs":{},"find":"2254.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2253","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"503953","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.48 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

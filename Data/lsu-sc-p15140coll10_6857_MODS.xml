In case it\nbade'emed best to strike the Red River below Fulton, at Conway, we leave the\npresent line at the Dorcheat, and instead of turning northerly, as at present, continue the general west course, by which we will be brought to the Red River at\nConway, in a distance of 20\u00a3 miles, in place of 40 7-10 miles, as by the precedent\n[toe. We thus save 19 2-10 miles of distance, and $272,563 of cost in construction, (equipment, engineering, &amp;c, remaining the same,) provided the cost\nper mile be the same as on the other line. But as the projected route to Conway will have to cross the ridges, it is possible it may cost more per mile ; and\ntor this allowing $50,000, leaves the total saving $223,000 ; giving the cost ofthe\nwhole road $3,342,000, and its length 175\u00a3 miles. In case we diverge at Beechland to take tho route to Fulton by the way of Springhill, we reach Fulton in a\ndistance from Beechland of 58 miles, instead of 67, as by the route surveyed;\nthus saving nine miles in distance, $128,000 in cost\u2014giving the cost of the whole\ntoad $1,437,000, and its length 185\u00a3 miles.\n(n case, after crossing the Washita, we do not cross the Loutre, but keep be-\ntweenit and the Washita, turning the heads of the Loutre near El Dorado, and\nfalling into the present line at Darden's, ten miles from El Dorado, the distance\nwill be about the same ; and the cost and repairs of a bridge and heavy embankments over the Loutre and its bottom lands saved. This will not be less\nthan $30,000 in first cost. It is probable, moreover, that the ten miles between\nEl Dorado and Darden's has more favorable ground than any continuous ten\nmiles on the present route.    Hence I judge the route by El Dorado to be\nJust east of the Washita, in case we wish to avoid the bend to the southward\nwhich the Bartholomew makes before entering the Washita, and run more directly to Washita City, from a point in the present line south of Bastrop, we will\nhave ta cross the Bartholomew once with a draw-bridge, and the Washita at a\nplace inferior to the present\u2014Collier's Point. The line will, besides, on lower\nground require heavier embankment. But we will save the two bridges over\nthe Saira and Bceuf bayous, and also three miles of distance. The cost of the\ntwo routes will be nearly the same; and the question of a draw-bridge over the\nBartholomew on the one haud, and three additional miles of distance on the\n\u00b0ther, must influence the choice.\nThe above communicates all the iuformation I have gathered in relation to a\nrail-road between Lake Providence and the Red River, near Fulton, constructed\nin the be3t and most permanent manner usual in the United States.    Modtfica-\nluns may be made to lessen the cost, and in some cases temporary constructions\n\u25a0ay be adopted. Thus, through the swamps it would be expedient to build the\nWtttmeiits and piers of all the bridges of timber, and make the approaches to the\nndges over the low grounds of trestles.    By this, two points will be gained :\n6 exact necessary amount of water-way may be ascertained by observation,\n\"da road provided by which to transport  material for the permanent con-\nA piled or trestled road across the swamp, of the necessary height, and properly braced, would not cost less than an embanked road, and would  not have\ns quality of permanency belonging to the latter.\nat - iiW.mmoa road, from Lake Providence to the Washita, to be kept above water\n$1(1(1 nltTie3' yjnld be located near the line traced.    The earth-work would cost\nttm timbers, piers, and trestles for the bridges, $5,000;   and their super-\nJ^hu-e, $13,000; total, $418,000.

Plank is by all means the best covering for\nwhich        frovidence to the Washita, $60,000 in addition.    Beyond the Washita,\nWell t!VVou'^ be crossed by a ferry, the line traced by our survey indicates very\nficje .,'e Proper route for a common road : and on this line a road embanked suf-\ny tor drainage, with good side ditches, culverts, and bridges, may be built","fullrs":{},"find":"2264.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2263","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"579683","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.55 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

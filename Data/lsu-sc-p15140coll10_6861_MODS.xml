Upoi.\n\"careful examination of a map of the country, it will be found to be one of the\nLjn connecting links of that great system of \" main trunk lines\" of rail-road\ntraversing the United States. Crossing the Mississippi River at a point\nwhere it will connect with those immense thoroughfares which load to all the\njmDortant commercial centres of the West, and to the great marts of the East,\non the Atlantic seaboard\u2014finding at Portland, Maine, a connection with the\neitcnsion of the projected Halifax and Quebec lines of railway, now under process of survey by the \"European and North American Rail-Road Company;\"\ntraversing the provinces of New-Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the Canadas,\nria Quebec, Montreal, to the Falls of Niagara, up along the northern shores of\nLake Erie, to where it intersects the \" Great Western Railway of Canada,\" that\nbrings you to Detroit, the completion of which is now deemed certain, under the\nguarantee of the British government and these North American provinces.\nAnother striking feature in the Arkansas road, which must be kept in view, is,\nthat it will, by its connection with the Memphis and Charleston road, intersect\nthe New-Orleans and Jackson Rail-road, in its onward course through the state\nof Tennessee\u2014spanning at one bound the North American states and the British\nprovinces, connecting the two oceans, and the great northern inland seas ; binding in \"bands of iron\" and locomotive attraction, all that new world of commerce, trade, and travel; concentrating and diffusing, with lightning speed, that\n\u00bbast and swelling stream of intelligence, and march of the human mind, now the\nwonder and admiration of the age.\nI trust it will not be considered extravagant for me to say, before this body\nof patriots, congregated here on an occasion that will be chronicled in history,\nwhat is admitted on all sides, though not adhered to for any effective purpose,\nthat as the laws of trade are inviolable, the country which, like the Mississippi\n\"alley, is possessed ofthe greatest number of materials necessary for manufactures, will be the ultimate manufacturers ; and the time is close at hand, when\nthe world will scarcely believe that such a state of things could by any possibility\nhave existed, as to have permitted raw materials to go to England from one\ncomment, and food from another, for the production of goods to sell in a third.\nny this we arrive at a point which may well be considered as a main element in\n,8 view \u00b0f die resources of that vast region of country west of the Mississippi,\nHence the growing manufactures of that valley must draw a majority of their\nfphes, and in which it must find an expansive market for their fabrics deli niliug upon that great rail-road system, to extend from the Mississippi to the\nhe American mind, fresh from the completion of canals and rail-roads, of\nwitl\"1\"!10 P.roPort'OIls&gt; m die older states, and from the acquisition of California,\npaii- 1 n\u00b0'' resources\u2014what is there in this Pacific road that should make us\nhav^Vi^ LlS'! we admit the enterprise to be a colossal one; and yet who will\n\u25a0ne assurance to say that we have not the means and energy proportioned to\nHow other great works, laid out for the American race upon this continent.\nand tlCaU We accomplish it ?

The adoption of this guage by the Pacific or St. Louis Road,\nand now by ours, will establish this as the uniform guage West of\nthe Mississippi River.\nThe grading of the whole road is very light. Over a large portion, the embankments are only rail igh to ensure\nperfect drainage. From Berwick's Bay to Washington, with the\nexception of about four miles, the whole line is high and dry above\nany danger of overflow. A portion of the lower division is subject\nto the overflow of crevasses. It has never been calculated to build\nthe road above high water mark\u2014there would be many objections\nto it. By it the cost of the road would be vastly increased, whilst\nit would operate greatly to the injury of all the lands between the\nroad and the river. In the time of a crevasse instead of the water\nbeing allowed to run back and spread over the swamps and low\nground, in the rear of the river, it would be dammed up by the embankments of the road, thereby causing the whole of the land next\nthe river to be overflowed. This plan would meet wilh violent opposition from all the planters on -the river. Instead of this, it is proposed to place as little obstruction as possible in the way of crevasse\nwater, by building our embankments sufficiently far from the river,\nas to allow the force of the current to be spent before reaching\nthem, and building only so high as to ensure drainage, we sustain\nno injury, except from a temporary delay in the  operation of the\nEfficient means should also be taken to guard against crevasses,\nby having all exposed points properly secured.\nIt is to be considered too, that the construction itself of the road,\nwill make the danger of crevasses less than they are now, as it will\nbe the means of speedy transportation of workmen and materials to\nany point that may be threatened. Immediately where a crevasse\noccurs, the water runs through it with great velocity, but it soon\nspreads over a large extent of ground, losing its velocity as it recedes from the river, until at a distance of a half mile it is not sufficient to injure our embankments, protected as they will be by a\nthick matting of grass and weeds.\nd2","fullrs":{},"find":"2400.jp2","dmaccess":{},"dmimage":{},"dmcreated":"2012-01-18","dmmodified":"2012-01-18","dmoclcno":{},"dmrecord":"2399","restrictionCode":"1","cdmfilesize":"510556","cdmfilesizeformatted":"0.49 MB","cdmprintpdf":"0","cdmhasocr":"1","cdmisnewspaper":"0"}</dmGetItemInfo>

In this calculation I have thrown out al! stop\npages, breakage of machinery, shifting of anchors, etc., which\nprovision made for the immense  amount  of sediment  con-\nis rather increased by the character of the  excavation, the\nimpracticability of ordinary dredging machines on the tidal\nCapt.

Anything which has a tendency to divert the\nsurface currents to  the  bottom,   or   which  increases   the\nunder  current   and  agitates   the   sediment,   may be con\nsulted as e\\, 11 in    rli    mil, illucnce on the Passes.

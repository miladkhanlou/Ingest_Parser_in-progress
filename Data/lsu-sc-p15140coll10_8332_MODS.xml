   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Members of the Ellis family of Tangipahoa Parish, La. included prominent lawyers, judges, politicians, planters, and clergymen. Ezekiel Parke Ellis (1807-1884) moved to St. Tammany Parish, La. as a young man, where he studied law under Judge Thomas Cargill Warner. He was a practicing attorney until his election to the Sixth Judicial District Court. He married Judge Warner's daughter, Tabitha Warner, and together they had six children. All three sons entered the legal profession. Thomas C. W. and Stephen Dudley went on to become judges; and Ezekiel John, served in the state senate and the U. S. Congress. Both Thomas and Ezekiel served in the Confederate Army doing the Civil War. Several of Ezekiel Parke's descendants continued in the legal profession and public life.</note>

  </titleInfo>
   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Thomas Affleck (1812-1868), planter, son of Thomas and Mary (Hannay) Affleck, was born on July 13, 1812, in Dumfries, Scotland. He studied agriculture at the University of Edinburgh before coming to the United States, where he arrived on May 4, 1832. On April 19, 1842, he married Anna Dunbar Smith, the niece of Jane Wilkinson Long, at Washington, Mississippi, where he established one of the earliest nurseries in the South and operated several plantations. In 1858 he moved to Texas and established Glenblythe Plantation and the Central Nurseries near Brenham. His Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book and Sugar Plantation Record and Account Book, prepared as a record of Glenblythe, became models for other planters in the area."(Handbook of Texas Online, http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/AA/faf3.html)</note>

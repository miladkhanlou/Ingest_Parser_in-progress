   <note type="content">'The second Baton Rouge campus of Louisiana State University occupied the grounds of the U. S. Army garrison in 1886, having moved from the first Baton Rouge campus on the grounds of the Louisiana State Institute for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind. The Lytle Studio created a number of photographs for the first LSU yearbook, The Gumbo, in 1900. The university was a military institution well into the twentieth century, with classes organized into companies along army models. This image of the Prize Company, 1887, indicates one such company that may have had the fewest demerits and best performance.'   Mark E. Martin, in Andrew D. Lytleâ€™s Baton Rouge: photographs 1863-1910, (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2008), p. 69.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Medals such as these were worn by members of the Rex court.  This one is found among the papers of Captain Thomas P. Leathers, a New Orleans steamboat master and owner.  The Rex Organization was founded in 1872 in an effort to entertain Russia's Grand Duke Romanoff during his visit to the city, to attract visitors to New Orleans, and to provide a daytime parade as an alternative to the rowdy processions that had come to characterize Mardi Gras celebrations.  The following year, it began the tradition of holding a ball and selecting a Queen of Carnival.   Rex continues; its parade is held on  Mardi Gras day.</abstract>

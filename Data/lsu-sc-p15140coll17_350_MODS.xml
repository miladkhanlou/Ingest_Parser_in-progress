   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The Spanish Town Mardi Gras Parade began in 1981 and traditionally features bawdy or politically-themed floats that reference current events.  These photographs were taken by Thomas W. Chandler for his 1985 LSU landscape architecture thesis, in which he surveyed and analyzed Spanish Town. Located between the State Capitol and Interstate 110 and bounded on the north and south by State Capitol Drive and Main St., respectively, Spanish Town is considered the oldest neighborhood in Baton Rouge. It was commissioned in 1805 as a settlement for Canary Islanders when Baton Rouge was still held by the Spanish .  In the 20th and 21st-centuries, it has been known for its socio-economic diversity and sense of community.</abstract>

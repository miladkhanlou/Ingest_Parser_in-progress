   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains ten letters from August through October 27, 1917, written by Hermann Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and to Rosalie Gottlieb, while he was at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas and at Camp MacArthur in Waco, Texas. Moyse discusses the end of his time at Citizens Training Camp, noting in a letter to Gottlieb his and other recruits' high spirits and that his time at camp has "greatly improved my ideas on human nature to be here and to see fellows working so steadily" for the common good.  He also writes about his initial impressions of Camp MacArthur (Sept. 5, 1917); his wish for peace in the coming year (Sept. 14, 1917); his tent-mates at Camp MacArthur, his life there, and how rapidly the camp is growing (Sept. 15 and 17, 1917); and finally about taking an advanced French language course, noting that to hear his Swiss teacher "speak about France, Belgium and the War (she came to America just after the beginning of the War) is to realize for the first time what a tragedy it has been" (Oct. 20, 1917).  Throughout the letters, he also relays news of mutual acquaintances.</abstract>

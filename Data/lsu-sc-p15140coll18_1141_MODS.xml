   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains four letters from July 4 through July 15, 1919, all written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  In a letter dated July 4, Moyse reminisces about the previous year's Fourth of July celebration in a French town named Massevaux during which the "Alsatian girls, ranging from tots to young mademoiselles in their teens, all dressed in the national costume, sang a verse of the Star Spangled Banner in English, [which] was so clearly an effort to please 'les Amricains,' to symbolize the unity that existed between the nations that I doubt whether there was an auditor who did not leave feeling more closely our friendly relations."  Moyse also writes about attending various luncheons and dinners at which he was asked to give a speech or which he attended as the guest of honor and describes his participation in an event at the Louisiana state penitentiary (July 4, July 7).  In a letter from July 11, Moyse mentions receiving a letter from Mrs. Abbott, one of his hosts at the ch√¢teau in France where he was convalescing after having been wounded.  In the final letter in the folder, Moyse describes the dinner he attended in honor of Bastille Day at which he gave a speech in French, jokingly noting "All I can say is that I lived through it last night and that none of my auditors threw any rotten eggs or cabbages" (July 15).</abstract>

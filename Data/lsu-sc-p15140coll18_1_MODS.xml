   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains eleven letters from February 20 through August 1, 1917, written by Hermann Moyse to his parents Simon and Flora Moyse, and to Rosalie Gottlieb, while he was in a small town in France, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas.  Moyse relates his first impressions of Fort Logan H. Roots, including mealtimes, lodging, the initial physical examination, daily activities, and training in bayonet fighting and trench warfare (ca. May 1917; Aug. 1, 1917).  He also mentions General Woodsâ€™s message to the young recruits to "devote ourselves to the work in hand so that when we took charge of men those men would have a sporting chance at least" (June 9, 1917), and writes of recent social events including a Zeta Beta Tau fraternity dance and other parties at LSU, as well as engagements and weddings of mutual friends (June 9 and 23, 1917; July 22, 1917).  Moyse states his determination to devote himself wholeheartedly to his training in order to become the best soldier possible, declaring in a letter to his parents dated July 22, 1917, "that no matter what happens I am a better man for having been at this camp" and his "one hope, if I am granted a commission, is not that I shall acquire fame, but that I may be able properly to look after the men placed under my charge."</abstract>

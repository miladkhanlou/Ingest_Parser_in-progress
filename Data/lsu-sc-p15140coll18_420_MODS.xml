   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains four letters from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb, written during his time in France with the 32nd Division, American Expeditionary Forces. Moyse describes his experiences 'installing' French soldiers in various towns (April 6, 1918) and how proud he is of his fellow soldiers who are always willing to take on any task, no matter how menial, without hesitation or complaint (April 14, 1918).  On April 20, 1918, the third-month anniversary of his arrival in France, Moyse describes his arrival in the country from England: the crowd of French children who greeted the soldiers, asking for American coins as souvenirs; the French lady who raised the American flag when she saw the soldiers arrive; and the generally enthusiastic welcome he received.  Moyse also mentions how welcome letters from Gottlieb are, particularly when she writes of "engagements, weddings, [and] scandals."</abstract>

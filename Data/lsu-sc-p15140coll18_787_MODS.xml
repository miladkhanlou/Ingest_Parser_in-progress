   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains seven letters from December 14 through December 28, 1918, four of which are from Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The folder also contains a letter from a Frenchwoman named Germaine Giraudeau who was a neighbor of one of Moyse's acquaintances and writes to Moyse to ask for help in finding an American pen pal (December 14).  The folder also contains Special Orders No. 286, dated December 23, signed W.D. Connor, granting Moyse a three-day leave of absence ‘with permission to visit Paris.’  The final item in the folder is a letter from a fellow soldier named Reginald [last name unknown] who writes Moyse and others with the news that he is returning to the United States (December 25).  In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse writes of various dinners and evenings spent with old friends and fellow soldiers with whom he had lost contact over the course of the war.  He also writes about his first time in a French movie theatre, mentioning that he prefers American movies to French ones (December 19).  Moyse also gives Gottlieb more information on his deceased soldier friend, Bill Weine, declaring him one of the "truest Americans" he ever knew (December 23).  In his final letter in the folder, Moyse describes his brief visit to Paris for Christmas, marveling at the beauty of the city and the excitement in the streets and noting the "sufficiency of light to make one feel that the world is bright again" (December 28).</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This folder contains eleven letters dating from January 1 through January 28, 1919, seven of which were written by Hermann Moyse to Rosalie Gottlieb.  The four other items in the folder are letters to Moyse, three from fellow soldiers Levi Stevens and Guy M. Wilson (the folder contains both the original handwritten letter from Wilson and a typed copy), and one letter from Moyses deceased friend Bill Weines father, Paul Weine.  Stevens writes Moyse with news of various casualties and wounds among the soldiers from their company, calling Captain Bill Weine the most fearless man he ever knew (January 5).  Wilson praises Moyse for his bravery and leadership, writing that Moyse has missed the real joy of life in hearing the men tell how fearless you were and how calmly you acted after you were hit (January 28).  Paul Weine thanks Moyse for his sincere letter of condolence upon Bills death (January 6).  In the letters to Gottlieb, Moyse shares some of his combat experiences, and describes various evenings of entertainment, including attending concerts, variety shows, and, in a letter dated January 9, a Charlie Chaplin movie.  He also mentions running into various soldier friends with whom he had not had contact since before he was wounded (January 27).  In the same letter, he describes a particular incident of bravery he heard about that occurred on February 5, 1918: the ship Tuscania was torpedoed and sinking and the commanding officer turned to the men and reminded them that they were Americans and that their duty toward their country, if their fate was to die, was to die like Americans with a smile upon their lips and without fear.  His words and his example held the men at attention so that when a rescuing British destroyer finally came along they marched in perfect order off the doomed ship to safety without a single loss.  Moyse notes that the story is one of cool-headed bravery on the part of every member of the platoon, the kind that really saves mens lives.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Amélie Duplantier, Paris, addresses her cousin Antoine Allard Duplantier as 'uncle' in a brief note.  She says that she received a large package of letters from New Orleans and is forwarding one destined for his address.  She breaks off to write a note to her cousin's wife, Henriette, whom she calls both 'cousin' and 'aunt.'  She refers fondly to Henriette's little girl, Isabelle.  Although Duplantier implies that she is forwarding a New Orleans letter, the longer letter included with her notes to Antoine Allard Duplantier and his wife, Henriette, is from someone who had visited 'Eugène' [Augustin Séraphin Eugène Tivollier] at his French boarding school [possibly in Lyon] the day of the letter's composition and who lives or is staying in the same locale as Eugène.  The longer letter (undated but composed at 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday) is from 'J.C.' to 'Madame Allard Duplantier at Voiron.'  The addresser (a man) refers to the addressee as 'my very dear cousin.'  On the back appears, 'Mme. Nina is going to La Martelière next week.'  The addresser states that he is happy to receive news from the addressee concerning the Amélie who is Eugène's mother [Jeanne Amélie Joséphine Allard Duplantier, wife of André Louis Séraphin Tivollier and daughter of Magdeleine Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier and Guy Antoine Joseph Allard Duplantier].  He refers to Amélie’s being treated by bloodletting for an illness while pregnant.  The writer devotes the bulk of the letter to the sick and pregnant Amélie’s son Eugène.  The addresser defends Eugène's inquietude, as the boy, away at school, has been left in the dark concerning the gravity of his mother's illness and other occurrences at Voiron.  The writer criticizes both the fact that Eugène has not been informed of his brother Jules's first communion and the young age at which Jules received the sacrament.  He relates Eugène's reactions to being shown family correspondence and reports taking the child to the writer's place as well as to a shoemaker's during the 30-minute afternoon snack break the day before the letter's composition.  The addresser describes Eugène's preparations for first communion.  He states that on the same day that he wrote the letter, he procured the child a copy of The Imitation of Christ at the latter's request;  at the same time, the addresser took a bundle of letters to forward from Eugène to the child's mother.  The writer states that he is sending a package to Nicolas as well.  Aware that 'Mr. Séraphin' plans to visit Eugène toward the end of the month, the author provides the school's schedule for leaves.  The addresser gives a list of items and their costs for reimbursement.  They include purchases for 'Mme. Allard' and 'Mme. Henriette' and payment to 'Mme. Marcel.'  In closing, the writer sends his best to Antoine and Séraphin.</abstract>

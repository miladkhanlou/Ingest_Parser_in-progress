         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Addressee)">1726-1801: Jean Claude Trénonay's brother-in-law and father to Armand Duplantier.  ‘Allard’ served in the Chambre de Députés after the French Revolution as the deputy from Dauphiné and Isère.</note>
   <note type="biographical/historical"
         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Born in Voiron, France, on June 28, 1753, to Joseph Guy Allard du Plantier (1721-1801) and Jeanne Gabrielle Trénonay Allard du Plantier (ca. 1724-1797), Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Sr.') came to the Americas in 1778, attached to the Foix Regiment sent to support the American Revolution. He served as an aide-de-camp to General Lafayette. Mustered out of the service in 1780, he attempted to find a commission in the American forces under George Washington but was refused. At the invitation of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay, Armand traveled to Louisiana. He first intended to make the trip by sea, but was turned back by the events surrounding the siege of Charleston. He then made the voyage overland, starting in Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) and descending the Ohio River. His first expedition down the Ohio turned back under threat of capture by the Shawnee, allies of the British. The second attempt reached Vincennes safely, and from there, Armand gained the Mississippi River, arriving in Pointe Coupee Parish in March 1781. Armand married Augustine Gérard, his uncle's stepdaughter, in July 1781. She bore him seven children, only four of whom survived: Fergus Augustin Duplantier (1783-1844), Armand Allard Duplantier (1785-1862), Guy Allard Duplantier (1791-1835), and Augustine Eulalie Duplantier (1799-1864), wife of Louis Favrot (1788-1876).  Augustine Gérard Duplantier died in 1799 during an outbreak of yellow fever, shortly after giving birth to their surviving daughter.  Three years later, in 1802, Armand married Constance Rochon (d. 1840), widow of John Joyce (d. 1798), and through her gained possession of Magnolia Mound Plantation in Baton Rouge.  Constance bore him five more children: Euphémie Amelia Duplantier (1804-1826), wife of Anthony F. Peniston, Sr. (1796-1826), Augustin Duplantier (1805-1860), Didier Duplantier (1806-1835), Alberic Nicholas Duplantier (1808-1891), and Alfred Joseph Duplantier (1813-1892).  Beginning with the death of his uncle Jean-Claude Trénonay in 1792 and the complications in settling the estate, Armand was involved in continual legal and financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.  He dabbled in land speculation to augment the income from his plantation, but none of his schemes appears to have been successful. In addition, the United States government refused to recognize Spanish land grants in Louisiana, making it impossible for Armand to sell what land he owned before the Louisiana Purchase. With his debts mounting, his wife petitioned the courts for a separation of property in 1814. When Armand died in 1827, he was deeply in debt. His funeral procession included an honor guard from the local garrison in Baton Rouge, in recognition of his service in the American Revolution. Armand is buried in Highland Cemetery in Baton Rouge.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Allard Duplantier, Pointe Coupée, writes his father, Joseph Allard Duplantier, indicating that the latter has received the portrait described in the author's April 12, 1785, letter, and that the Mr. Allard mentioned in the same is from Remollon, France.  The writer relates having lost a son in childbirth and elaborates upon his wife's ill health.  He gives the names and birth information of his two surviving children as Fergus, born October 8, 1783, at Pointe Coupée, and Armand, born January 11, 1785, in New Orleans.  He states the reasons for wanting to send his wife and children to France and confesses not knowing that his father was 66 years old.  Duplantier affirms that his uncle Trénonay did not give him the plantation on which he resides, which was what the writer's other uncle, 'Lagoyête,' had told the addressee.  The addresser asserts that 'Mr. de lacize' [Nicolas de Lassize], commandant of the Pointe Coupée post, has said that he did not give 'Lagoyête' such information.  Duplantier points out that the plantation belonged to his wife's grandfather and that the writer bought it after the latter's death.  Duplantier says that he will try to have a portrait of himself done the next time that he is in New Orleans so as to send it and one of his younger sons to his parents.  He likewise requests portraits of his parents and discusses the seeds sent to him from Europe.  In closing, the addresser indicates that Fergus is called 'Plauton' because Duplantier remembers hearing that the recipient was given the same nickname when he was the child's age.  The writer extends his regards to a priest and a monk ('Mr. Le curé' and a 'penaillon').  He advises sending correspondence through the Brunaud brothers in Bordeaux, as they conduct business with Julien Poydras.</abstract>

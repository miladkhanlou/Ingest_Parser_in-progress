         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, addresses his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier, whom he calls 'Allard.'  The writer congratulates the recipient upon marrying and expresses his condolences over the death of Rose, a beloved maid at Le Plantier, France.  In fondly recalling Le Plantier, the addresser describes the garden and fountain there.  Duplantier relates that his eldest daughter, Célestine, married a French doctor, Mr. Daret, in 1838 and has a five-month-old son.  He says that his daughter Louise is not married and that his other daughter, Euphémie, is ten years old.  He adds that his two sons, Charles and Edouard, are at a college three leagues away.  The writer goes on to say that Fergus and 'Jaïs' are still at Baton Rouge, Fergus without children and Jaïs 'still a boy.'  He adds that Fergus has adopted two sons of the writer's half-sister, Euphémie, who died 12 years previously.  Duplantier states that his full-sister, Augustine (Madame Favrot), has a son and a daughter, the latter of whom has just married.  Of his half-brothers, he says that all are married and live near their mother in Baton Rouge.  The addresser notes that his late full-brother, Guy, left eight children, the oldest of whom, Amélie, has left for France with her aunt, Madame Avart.  He asserts that he will send the addressee some insect and reptile specimens and asks for something from Le Plantier in return.  He sends his best to Mr. Tivollier in closing.</abstract>

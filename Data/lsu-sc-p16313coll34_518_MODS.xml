         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Armand Allard Duplantier ('Armand, Jr.') was the second surviving son of Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier and Augustine Gérard Duplantier.  In 1802, his parents sent him to France for his education, although at age 17 he was considered too old to be going to school.  His father insisted that he study business and improve his handwriting.  Shortly after his return to Louisiana, he married Marie Fortin, and settled in Saint James Parish.  He served as a private in the 6th Regiment of the Louisiana Militia during the War of 1812.  Armand, Jr., lived at Sport Plantation, so named because of Duplantier’s love of horse racing.  He returned to France briefly in 1826 with his ailing daughter Louise to seek medical attention for her.  Despite his solicitude, she died in 1841.  Armand also lost his son Charles to the scarlet fever epidemic of 1859.  Armand, Jr., died in 1862 at age 77, a short time after his plantation had been looted by Union Soldiers during the Civil War.</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Armand Duplantier, Jr., St. James Parish, sends condolences to his cousin Antoine Frédérique Allard Duplantier upon the death of the latter's mother, Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier.  The writer states that he lost his oldest son, age 38, the previous April 20 and that the deceased left eight young children, the sixth daughter being born after her father's death.  Duplantier adds that his late son's two boys are five and three and a half years old.  The addresser recounts that his son succumbed to scarlet fever contracted by tending closely to four of his daughters, who brought the sickness home from school.  The writer gives a list of Duplantiers in Louisiana and briefly describes their economic situations.  The family members he includes are the late Fergus Duplantier, whose heirs are 'Fergus' and 'Antony' [Augustin Fergus Peniston and Anthony F. Peniston, Jr., sons of Fergus Duplantier’s late half-sister, Euphémie Duplantier Peniston];  Augustine Duplantier Favrot and her son and daughter, the latter married to Mr. 'Renaux' [Reynaud] and having a son who is a doctor like his father;  Augustin Duplantier (from Armand Duplantier, Sr.'s second marriage) and his brothers Albéric and Alfred Joseph;  Augustin's three daughters and one son;  Alfred's five daughters and two sons, the oldest daughter being married to Mr. Rouzan;  and Albéric's two daughters and two sons.</abstract>

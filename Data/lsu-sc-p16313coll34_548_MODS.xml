   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Augustine Eulalie Duplantier, Baton Rouge, writes her aunt Eduvige Allard Duplantier.  She says that her brother Guy has spoken much of their relatives in France and that she has asked him to ask their uncle for a copy of their mother's portrait.  She states that her Aunt Favrot has asked for a copy as well.  The writer remarks that a portrait from her mother's adolescence and descriptions of her from other people are the only things that help her form an image of someone she lost when just a baby.  The addresser also requests a portrait of the addressee.  Augustine Duplantier’s father, Armand Allard Duplantier, adds his own letter to the bottom of his daughter's.  He states that he regrets not having been able to send his daughter to France or return there himself.  He asserts that Mr. Le Bourgeois, who is going to Lyon, could be put in charge of the portrait of his daughter's mother.  Duplantier affirms that he and his sons think his second daughter, Euphémie, resembles the addressee, and he avows that the girl will be writing her aunt.</abstract>

         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes his sister, Gabrielle Duplantier, to announce the arrival of her son Armand Duplantier in Louisiana.  He speaks of economic conditions in the colony and of plans to attack Pensacola, Florida.  He mentions the Guimard family and Mr. Perrin and states that he fears Miss Masse is dead.  He suggests sending mail through Paul Bureau in La Rochelle, the Poupets in Cap Français, or the Count of Aranda via the 'Reverend Father' Lag[oyais?] and the Abbé Martinet.  He says that he is bringing the letter to a close so as to converse with Monferra.  He asserts that he is not going to write the 'reverend father,' who has refused to answer him (despite the opportunities that Miss Masse had afforded him to do so) and who (the author has learned) has a charming daughter with many advantages in store.  In a postscript, he recounts Augustin Mottin de La Balme’s death at the hands of Amerindians en route to the siege of Detroit.  He refers to his stepdaughter as his daughter and says that 'Edevige' is the subject of her conversations with Armand.</abstract>

   <note type="biographical/historical"
         displayLabel="Biographical Note (Author)">Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey ( also spelled Chanfret) was born into a family of minor nobility in Moirans, France.  In 1755, he joined his uncle, Claude René Trénonay de Chanfrey (1697-1768), in the French colony of Louisiana.  The elder Trénonay de Chanfrey had originally come to Louisiana to cultivate lands in Iberville Parish given in 1717 to his first cousins, the four Pâris brothers (principally Joseph Pâris Duverney, 1684-1770).  The elder Trénonay died in Pointe Coupee Parish.  Jean-Claude Trénonay de Chanfrey (known simply as 'Claude Trénonay') made his home on a plantation near New Roads.  He was a successful planter and land-speculator, but accusations of cruelty to his slaves made him unpopular with both the Spanish government of Louisiana and his fellow planters.  In 1771, he married Marie Augustine Allain, widow Gérard.  Her death in 1777 left him with a stepdaughter, Marie Augustine Gérard, whom he married off to his nephew, Armand Gabriel Allard Duplantier.  Although Trénonay had promised to care for the couple financially, he became estranged from them.  Trénonay was murdered in his home on July 10, 1792, by one of his slaves, called 'La Tulipe.'</note>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Claude Trénonay, Pointe Coupée, writes Joseph Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, whom the addresser mentions as having been at Versailles.  Trénonay claims that he has kept up with the French Revolution and the new constitution (which he praises and which is also mentioned in his March 11, 1790, letter) through papers sent by European friends.  He declares that he has heard of an approaching war between France and Spain that England might join on Spain's side before the National Assembly adjourns.  He mentions Guillaume-Thomas-François Raynal in passing.  Trénonay pleads Louisiana's case in hopes that France will take its former colony back, recounting the progress there over the years and the region's potential for the future, which would include slave trading as well as agriculture and various industries.  He relates some of his slave purchasing and the fact that Armand Duplantier has a third son. Trénonay states his belief that the boys should leave home for education and recounts how dismissed, mostly drunken, and vice-filled soldiers are used to instruct the colonists' children but end up only corrupting the latter.  Trénonay reiterates that his health and the currency situation keep him from returning to France, and he blames the governors and intendants for ruining Louisiana.  The writer discusses the 'reverend father' and mentions that the so-called person has a wife.  Trénonay links the 'reverend father' to Montferra's succession and criticizes him for not writing.  Trénonay refers to the recipient's pastor, Monsieur Perrin, while joking in the postscript about the addresser's 'patriotic sermon.'</abstract>

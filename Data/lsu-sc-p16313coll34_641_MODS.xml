   <abstract displayLabel="Description">William Joyce, Baton Rouge, writes his step-aunt Euphrosine Tivollier Allard Duplantier, Voiron, France, care of his step-niece, Amélie Duplantier.  He states that the carrier is travelling with her maternal aunt, Mme. Avart (who has 'adopted' her), and that she resembles her late father.  The addresser fondly recalls the time he spent among the recipient's family, and he asks the addressee to remember him to her Amélie (another Amélie) and to Séraphin.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Charles de Rabars, Bordeaux, to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Paris.  Charles de Rabars, a resident of the Bordeaux region of France, served in Napoleon's army with Antoine Doussan.  De Rabars also maintained a lengthy correspondence with Auguste Doussan, a relationship initiated at Antoine Doussan's behest. Auguste Doussan was the younger brother of Antoine Doussan.  He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. De Rabars relates news received in a letter from Antoine Doussan, Auguste's brother, including the illness of Antoine's wife, their plans to come to France next summer if her health permits, and Antoine's desire for de Rabars and Auguste to be in touch. De Rabars also writes of his military service with Antoine, who cared for De Rabars after the latter was gravely wounded at the end of the last campaign in Italy in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars. He also describes his work for customs at Bordeaux and his children's education.

   <note type="content" displayLabel="Summary">Bordeaux, France, August 4, 1828, Charles de Rabars to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Paris.  De Rabars had received a letter from Auguste's brother dated June 14, Baton Rouge.  Auguste's brother's wife has been ill since her mother's death.  Brother and wife are going to spend six months in a climate better than Louisiana's, coming to France next summer if her health permits.  Auguste's brother wants Auguste and De Rabars to be in contact with each other.  De Rabars says he served in the military with Auguste's brother, who cared for De Rabars after the latter was gravely wounded in the right shoulder at the end of the last campaign in Italy in 1813.  They have not seen much of each other since the events of 1814 other than during Doussan's last trip to France, the memories of which De Rabars' family still cherish.  De Rabars works for customs at Bordeaux, where he has been with his wife and two children for a year.  His son is 12 and in a 'collège.'  His daughter is 10 and is receiving her education at her mother's side.

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Charles de Rabars, Bordeaux, to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Paris. Charles de Rabars, a resident of the Bordeaux region of France, served in Napoleon's army with Antoine Doussan.  De Rabars also maintained a lengthy correspondence with Auguste Doussan, a relationship initiated at Antoine Doussan's behest. Auguste Doussan was the younger brother of Antoine Doussan.  He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. De Rabars writes of his friendship with and affection for Auguste Doussan and Auguste's brother, Antoine, to whom he refers as "Doussan," and of his sadness at the prospect of never seeing Antoine again. He also mentions his poor health and lists his ailments.

   <note type="content" displayLabel="Summary">Bordeaux, November 21, 1828, Charles de Rabars to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Paris.  Again, De Rabars talks about his friendship with Auguste and speaks well of Auguste's brother (Antoine, referred to as 'Doussan').  De Rabars realizes that if everything is satisfactory with Antoine in Baton Rouge, he will not visit France;  thus, De Rabars is saddened by the prospect that they might never see each other again.  De Rabars has not been well and lists his ailments.

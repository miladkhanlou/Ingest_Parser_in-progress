   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Antoine Doussan, Baton Rouge, to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Rue du Foin St. Jacques, Paris. The Doussans were an émigré French family who came to Louisiana in the wake of Napoleon's downfall.  The patriarch, Antoine, a medical doctor and former soldier under Napoleon, managed the family's cotton and sugar plantation in West Baton Rouge Parish as well as French-resident members' financial affairs in Louisiana.  Auguste Doussan was the younger brother of Antoine Doussan.  He practiced medicine in Grasse, France, and married Louise Perrin, who was a relative of the Allain family of Louisiana. Antoine Doussan writes to advise Auguste Doussan on his education. He suggests that Auguste attach himself to a professor who can advise him, mentioning 'Faymoreau' and 'Dr. Donadier', and instructs him to obtain a microscope and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's work on botany. He also writes that he has authorized Maison [Peltier?] to augment Auguste's monthly allowance and admonishes Auguste to buy only those books necessary for his studies. Antoine also describes his personal library.</abstract>
   <note type="content" displayLabel="Summary">Baton Rouge, December 5, 1827, Antoine Doussan to Auguste Doussan at Hôtel des Abeilles, Rue du Foin St. Jacques, Paris.  Antoine advises Auguste not to dwell on botany to the exclusion of the sciences of healing and to study botany as a doctor, not a naturalist.  The same applies to physics, math, and chemistry.  Auguste needs to focus on clinical lectures.  Antoine imagines Auguste will be taking anatomy and physiology.  'Faymoreau' and 'Dr. Donadier' are mentioned in a marginal note.  Antoine has given Faymoreau a rattlesnake tail and tooth.  Antoine is too far away to direct Auguste's studies, so he suggests that Auguste attach himself to a professor who can advise him.  Antoine is angry over the absence of a professorial chair for such advising.  Antoine instructs Auguste to receive Faymoreau well, and the latter can tell Auguste more about Antoine.  Antoine wants Auguste and Faymoreau to get him a Lamark botany (or any botany that might be better) as well as a microscope for botany.  Antoine has authorized Maison [Peltier?] to augment Auguste's monthly allowance.  Antoine admonishes Auguste to buy only those books necessary for his studies.  Antoine describes his personal library.  In a postscript, the writer adds, 'Ta belle-soeur t'envoie par Faymoreau dix piastres pour tes étrennes du jour de l'an.'</note>

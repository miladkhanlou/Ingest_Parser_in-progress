   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">500 DOLLARS REWARD, WILL be given for apprehending and lodging in jail the negro JERRY who absconded, it is supposed, on board the Steamer Columbus, for Cincinnati, about ten days since. Jerry is about 45 years of age, five feet ten or eleven inches in height,  ound stooped shoulders, very talkative and familar, fond of bartering and trading in horses, having been a hack-driver for some time past in this city. Jerry has no doubt obtained forged papers. his wife, who is free, accompanied him. She is a negress of small stature, and very talkative also. It is supposed he has assumed the name of WILLIAM, and that his wife calls him by that name. 100 dollars will be paid for securing him in any jail in this State; and 500 dollars for lodging him in any jail, if taken out of the State, with all reasonable expenses, besides, for bringing here.

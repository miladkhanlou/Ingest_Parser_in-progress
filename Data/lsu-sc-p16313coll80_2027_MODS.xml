He gives his name as JOSHUA, and says he is the property of JOHN BROWN, recently residing on Bayou DeGlaise in Avoyelles, but now removed to the ""Plains"" across the Mississippi River about 25 miles from Baton Rouge. Says he left his master on 26th December last. The boy had when taken up a Carpet Bag, some very good clothes, and $35 in money. The owner is notified to come forward, prove property, pay charges and take him away otherwise he will be disposed of as the law directs. ISRAEL GOREE. Jailor. Feb 22-2m</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Ran away from the Plantation of Mr. Grégoire Bodin, Cypremort Prairie, on the night of the 30th of July last, the negro boys BUCHAR and GOSS. Buchar is aged about 22 years, in height about 5 feet 6 inches, has a short step, a scar on the back of his head, is an old hand on the plantation, and is not quite so dark as his companion. Goss is about 18 years of age, in height about 5 feet 6 inches, has a large mark of a burn on one side, near the ribs; is very black, and has a little fur on his chin. A handsome reward will be given for the recovery of one or both of said negroes, and all expenses paid. They took with them a large supply of clothing, and started from home in a pirogue. GREGOIRE BODIN. 31-2t.</abstract>

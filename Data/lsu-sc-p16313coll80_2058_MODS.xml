   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">RANAWAY--FROM THE PREMISES OF THE undersigned on the morning of the 10th inst., negro girl FANNY. Said negro girl is of dark brown color, 21 years of age, about 5 feet 5 1/2 inches in height, stout but well-formed, and disposed to be very dressy. The only peculi-arity recollected about her person is, that one of her upper front teeth projects and is 1-16 of an inch longer than the rest of the set, which are good. The runaway is supposed to be harbored in the neighborhood by some of her friends. A liberal reward will be paid for her arrest, and an additional one for information that will lead to the detection and conviction of any one harboring her. JNO. THORNHILL, No. 6 Euterpe street. je13 tf</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">TO CAPTAINS OF STEAMBOATS -- FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD will be paid for the apprehension of the Black Boy JOHN, who ran away this morning. He was dressed with a blue cloth coat with large white buttons, and a pair of yellow cottonade pantaloons. He is about 28 year sold, 5 feet 3 1/2 or 4 inches high, stoutly built, very black skin, a handsome round face, very regular features, no beard, very white teeth. His shoulders are rather round. He is very intelligent, and speaks French and English. As he came from St. Louis, Mo., where he has his relations, it is supposed that he might attempt to go back to the same place. The above reward will be paid to any one who will arrest him and put in any jail between this city and St. Louis, by informing the subscriber ; or if he is brought to him, the expenses would be paid beside the reward.

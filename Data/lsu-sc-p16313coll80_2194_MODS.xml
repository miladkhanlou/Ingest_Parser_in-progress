   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away on the 25th January, my negro woman ELOUISE and her yellow childe LEESER. The woman is about 23 years of age, of griffe color, has a mould on her upper lip, between the mouth and the nose, has a front tooth out, and has large holes in her ears, a small scratch on her throat, speaks broken English, and is about 5 feet 4 or 5 inches high. Her child is a light mulatto 22 months old, has three or four teeth. She is likely and lively. They formerly belonged to Dr. Beauregard, and has been living with a man calling himself Callics, stone cutter, corner of St. Louis and Villere streets. A further reward of $20 will be paid on conviction, if harbored by a white person or free person of color. J.C. LABATT, 203 Julia street. fe9 3t</abstract>

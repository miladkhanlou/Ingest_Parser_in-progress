   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$100 Reward in Specie! RAN AWAY form my place, near Fairfield, Freestone county, Texas, about the 5th of October, 1864, my negro man ""IKE."" He is black, 25 years old, heavy built, 5ft, 7 or 8 inches high, weighs about 175 pounds.  The forefinger and thumb of his right hand is signficantly deformed from a gunshot in the palm joints.  Ike is very considerate and smart in conversation.  Will perhaps assume another name, and say he belongs to Government trains, or a refugee from La., or some unknown person.  In my absence, ""Ike"" fought my foreman with an axe, doing consider able damage. I brought him from Floyd, in Carroll parish, in 1862.  He will doubtless attempt to make his way back.  I will pay the above reward if taken in La., and fifty dollars if taken in Texas, or in proportion as he may near the La. State Line --- and secured so that I can get him. W.A. MILNER.

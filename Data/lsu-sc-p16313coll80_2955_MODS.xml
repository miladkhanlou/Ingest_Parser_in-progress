   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Stop the Runaways. RANAWAY from my residence, Bossier Point. 6 miles from Fillmore, on the night of the 15th inst., the bright mulatto boy IKE, or Isaac. He is about 21 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches high, weighs about 175 pounds, is slighty round-shouldered and when walking keeps his head inclined to one side. His complexion is very fair and if he has any whiskers they are of a sandy color; but all his actions and manners are of the negro.  It is probable that he will attempt to pass himself as a white man. D. MALONE, Fillmore, Bossier parish. Also-The negro boy BOOTS, aged about 30 years, rather under the ordinary height, complexion black, very bow-legged, walks parrot-toed, and weighs about 145 pounds. The only mark recollected on his person is a knot on the left wrist, caused by the same being dislocated. Also-The negro girl LOUISE, aged about 20 years, complexion jet black, very well made, and neat and trim in person; about the common height. Her eyes are large and the whites of them very clear. It is thought that the above negroes are in company, and Ike (or Isaac) will try to pass Boots and Louise off as his slaves. A liberal reward will be paid for the apprehension of them. J. J. STEWART, Fillmore, Bossier parish, La. nov 22-4t*</abstract>

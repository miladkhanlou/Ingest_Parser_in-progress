   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Ranaway FROM the subscriber, living near Fillmore, Bossier parish, a negro boy named BOTTS, but will probably call himself Hartwell. He is low and stoutly built, weighing about 140 pounds; is 28 years old; parrot-toed in walking; has an evident dislocation of the left-wrist; very bad teeth and looks one in the face when speaking. He may be in company with a white man, and may possibly aim for Texas. A suitable reward will be paid for the delivery of said boy to me, or if lodged in jail so that I can get him again. Or I will pay a reward of one hundred dollars for the apprehension and conviction of any one who may have enticed him from Fillmore. J. J. STEWART. Bossier parish, La. February 7, 1855.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">Negro Thieves amongst Us! ABSCONDED OR STOLEN-A negro boy, aged about 18 years, some 4 feet 9 inches high, copper color; heavy built for his height. He is a boy of some shrewdness. Left his home about the 5th January last, and it is believed was enticed away by some scoundrel. Calls himself Luke, sometimes Lewis. He had on his person no marks now recollected, with the exception of a few whip lashes about the shoulders. I will pay a liberal reward to any one who will return said boy to me, at Powellton, Harrison county, Texas, or lodge him in jail so that I can get him again. I will also pay a liberal reward for the apprehension and conviction of any person or persons who may have decoyed the boy away from his home. W. F. NEAL, M. D., Powellton, Harrison county, Texas. feb20-4t*</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$25 Reward. RUNAWAY from the subscribers on the 30th ult. The negro boy GEORGE. He is of copper color, spare built, between 19 and 20 years of age, very slow spoken, and leans over a little when walking. George was seen in Shreveport a few days ago seeking employment; and having been puchased in N. Orleans he will probably endeavor to get on some boat bound to that city. The above reward of $25 will be paid for delivery of said boy to us in Jefferson, Texas, or for his apprehension and detention in any jail so that we can get him again. H. RHINE &amp; BROS. Jefferson, October 13, 1858.</abstract>

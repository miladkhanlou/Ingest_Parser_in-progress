   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD--RANA-way from the subscriber's place, on Pearl river, 7 miles below Monticello, Lawrence County, Miss., on the 24th of February last, the following described negroes: SAM, about 5 feet 8 inches in height, well built, black complexion, thick bushy head of hair, whiskers and moustache, rather pleasant countenance, downcast and furtive look when spoken to, had on when he left, thick boots, white linsey pants and blue satinet jacket, aged about 29 years. STEPHEN, about 5 feet 7 inches (or under) well built, erect in his gait, dark complexion, rather a surly and bold look when spoken to, slow and grim tone in his speech - had on when he left, boots, white linsey pants, blue satinet jacket and linsey jacket underneath; aged about 30 years. They are supposed to have been run off by a man named T.C. Browder. The above reward will be paid for the arrest and confinment of both in any jail so that I may get them, or $25 for either one. S.A.

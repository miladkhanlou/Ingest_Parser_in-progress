   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">NOTICE. $100 REWARD. For the negro man ""HOLMES,"" if caught in this State and delivered to his owner on Black River. $200 for him if caught out of this State and delivered to his owner. HOLMES formerly belonged to Dr. Qual , in Triniyt, where he led a quiet life -- half loager -- half jockey and well known for his easy assurance in asking gentleman for the loan of their ready saddled horses ""to ride a quarter or so, up town."" Knowing his accomplishments, his present owner permitted him to go to New Orleans and select his master and congenial occupation ; nnut that place upon trial, was not agrreable to him. He returned  thence to Black River, and tried planting, which upon two days faithful work, did'nt exactly suit tastes and former habits. So he suddenly prefered French leave, with which it is supposed he is decidely pleased, as he has not been seen by his owner since. He is copper colored -- about 6 feet high and very stout.

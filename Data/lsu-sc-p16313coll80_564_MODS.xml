   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS Reward will be paid for the apprehension of the boy ALBERT. He ran away from ""Rienzi Plantation,"" opposite Thibodaux, about three months ago. I have received intelligence of his having been seen in this neighborhood a few days since. The above reward will be paid for his delivery to me, or on being lodged in the Thibodaux jail-less jail fees. Albert is about forty years of age, six feet one to two inches high, black, with broad upper front teeth, has rather a feminine voice, and a quick, intelligent though rather downcast countenance.

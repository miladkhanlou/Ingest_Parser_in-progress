   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD. Ranaway from the subscriber, on Christmas night last, the black woman NANCY, aged about 33 years; she is of spare habit, about 5 feet 6 inches high, and has lost her upper front teeth. She took with her the mulatto boy FRANK or MOSE, aged about 6 years, of a sprightly, intelligent countenance; her mulatto girl VICTORINE, aged about 4 years; and her child GUS, aged 3 months. The above slaves recently belonged to Dr. G.W. Dearing, of Baton Rouge, and were purchased by the subscriber on the 4th inst., at the auction mart of R.W. Long. Fifty dollars will be paid on the recovery of the above slaves, and $50 upon the arrest and conviction of the person--supposed to be white--who inveigled them away and is now harboring them.

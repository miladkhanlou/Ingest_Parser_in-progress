   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$25 Reward -- Paid on Delivery. RANAWAY from the undersigned on the 20th of September, a yellow girl named AGNIS, well known about town as being engaged in peddling fruit for two years past, -- she is 23 or 24 years of age, has four front teeth out, ha teter worm on her lef arm, of small size, and straight black hair, had on a yellow strpied gingham dress when she left home. I will also pay twenty five dollars for any positive proff if any person or persons that has harbored or concealed her ; it is very likely that she has been coaxed off by a loafer at the river, who made her believe that he would buy her.

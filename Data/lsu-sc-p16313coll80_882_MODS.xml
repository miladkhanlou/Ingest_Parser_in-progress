   <abstract displayLabel="Transcript">$600 REWARD. RANAWAY from the undersigned, on the  night of the 9th ult., five miles from Lloyd's bridge, on the Burr's Ferry road, the following describe slaves, viz.: A man named TYREE, light griffe, aged about thirty-six years, about five feet, nine inches high. A negro man named WILSON, dark griffe, aged about thirty-five years, about five feet, eight inches high, stout and thick set, a front tooth missing. A negro man named McCoy, aged nineteen years, and about five feet, eight inches high. A negro girl named ROSETTA, aged about twenty years. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS each will be paid for the apprehension and delivery to me of any of all of said slaves, at any point between Bayou Bœuf and Burr's Ferry. Also, ran away from my plantation, on the Bayou Bœuf: A negro man named GEORGE, aged about thirty-six years, and Another negro named ALLEN, aged about  twenty-six years. One hundred dollars will be paid for the apprehension and delivery to me of said men, at any point between my residence and Burr's Ferry. The two named slaves are believed to be on or in the neighborhood of my plantation, and the others will most probably resort to the same point at an early day. GEORGE R. KING. St. Landry, September 12. 1863. --tf--28.

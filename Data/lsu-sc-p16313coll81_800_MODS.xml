   <abstract displayLabel="Description">John B. Heroman, Sr., amateur photographer that he was, submitted a number of photographs for contests. While the reverse of these images have been labeled with a rubber stamped form giving the title, his name as photographer, the name of the contest, and a note indicating sufficient postage has been included to return the image, we do not know to whom the images were submitted. The contest themes included “street scenes.” “portraits,”and “freak” photos. In this context, “freak” photos are images that include multiple images of one subject interacting with themselves, most often appearing to simply look at “each other” across the image. One of these images features three boys at a table playing cards with themselves. </abstract>

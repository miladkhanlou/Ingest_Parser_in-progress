   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Francis Palms, 'Starvation Hollow, Near Alexandria, Louisiana', writes to Henrietta Lauzin, Honey Suckle Grove, West Baton Rouge, to inform her of his recent travels, including his time in the Capital, , possibly referring to Shreveport, which was the capital of Confederate Louisiana at this time.  In reference to his time in the Capital he states, 'I never became so tired of a place in my life- the fare was meager and the prices exorbitant $20 per day- fruits were in abundance- melons were plentiful and in consequence I was never melon-choly.' He then recounts the last eight letters Henrietta had sent to him and comments on their contents before closing.</abstract>

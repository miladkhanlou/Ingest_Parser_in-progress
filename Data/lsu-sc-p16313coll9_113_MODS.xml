   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female girl, all-composition doll, open mouth with four upper teeth, sleeping eyes, lashes, mohair wig with braid, swivel neck, jointed at shoulders and hips, white organdy underwear, under-skirt trimmed with lace. Green, yellow, red plaids knee length high waist dress, white lace trimmed pinafore, flat sole shoes, manufactured doll body, costume, machine-made. Accompanying information describes as Flora Madame Alexander doll. This Madame Alexander doll was very popular in the 1920s. The costume is that of the 1890s. The dolls of Beatrice Alexander Berhman and the Alexander doll company are so popular with modern doll collectors that entire books could be written about them (and have been). The reasons for this popularity are not hard to find. Not only have Madame Alexander dolls been comparatively well made, but many of them display an incisive feeling for subject matter that is popular at a given moment. Madame Alexander has had a knack at least since the 1930s for making portrait dolls of the very people and literary characters who seem to personify an age. (Ref. 1) (Ref. 2) Several places of doll's face and body are cracked.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female child, frozen charlotte, glazed China pillar doll molded and painted features and hair, molded and painted boots, lace underwear, white lace trimmed dress, ribbon sash tied at back, manufactured doll body, dress, hand-made, Frozen charlottes are one-piece molded porcelain dolls that are completely unjointed. Known as pillar dolls, solid China dolls, or bathing babies, they were produced either glazed or unglazed and in a variety of grades and sizes. Most Frozen charlottes are chubby nudes of indeterminate sex with clenched fists and bent elbows. The wide variety of hair styles would suggest that the dolls were indeed intended to be female, although it should be remembered that through most of the 19th century male and female children were dressed and combed identically. Modern doll collectors who insist that they know a male frozen charlotte when they see one and call such dolls 'frozen charlies'. Pillar dolls range in size from one to over eighteen inches high and occasionally wear molded bonnets or hair ribbons, despite their nudity. Of the several explanations of the term 'frozen charlotte,' the most plausible derives from a civil War ballad about 'fair charlotte,' who, eager to be wooed by her suitor one winter's night, went out into the Vermont cold wearing only a silken cloak and promptly froze to death.

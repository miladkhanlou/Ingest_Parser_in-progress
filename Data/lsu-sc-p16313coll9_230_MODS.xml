   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Female adult, plant woven face and all body, two colors, no other materials, wide brim hat, full length skirt, standing on wooden plate, all, hand-made. Accompanying information describes as a Mexican doll. Mexico has become a land of dolls. These are made of many different kinds of materials and in numerous different ways. The Mexicans have great skill in putting character into their dolls and show great ingenuity and patience in whatever type of doll they undertake to make. The hats of Mexican dolls are beautifully handwoven.  No matter how small and cheap a doll may be, the hat is properly made.</abstract>

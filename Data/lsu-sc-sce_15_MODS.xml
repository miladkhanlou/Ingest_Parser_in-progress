   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Edward N. Marsh was a private in the 52nd Massachusetts Infantry. The 52nd arrived in Baton Rouge to occupy the city on December 17, 1862.  In a letter to his brother and sister, written on a sheet of paper from a ledger he “liberated” from a Baton Rougean’s home, Private Marsh describes the scene in Baton Rouge, including his unit's landing, soldiers' taking items from homes, the town's deserted appearance, and the conditions of "contrabands," slaves who fled to the Federal encampments in Baton Rouge.</abstract>

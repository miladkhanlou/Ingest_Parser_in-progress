   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In 1847, noted English publisher William Pickering brought out an unusual edition of Euclid edited by an otherwise unknown mathematician named Oliver Byrne.  The book's startlingly modern diagrams make an interesting contrast with the elegant but very Victorian cribl√© initials that decorate the typography.Byrne's edition covers the first 6 books of Euclid's Elements of Geometry, which range through most of elementary plane geometry and the theory of proportions. The striking diagrams are the result of Byrne's attempts to present Euclid's proofs in pictures, using as little text - and in particular as few labels - as possible.</abstract>

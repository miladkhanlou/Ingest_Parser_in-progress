   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Teachers of logic have long used games as a tool for students.  Textbooks of logic dating back to the early sixteenth century1 present it as a game for an individual student. Lewis Carroll's The Game of Logic (1887) follows in the same tradition, employing humor as well as gaming to engage the student.

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In February 1964, the Supreme Court overturned a Louisiana law requiring segregation of public park facilities. In May of that year, U.S. District Judge E. Gordon West ordered the integration of the Recreation and Parks Commission facilities, which included the public pools. The commission decided to fill in the pool at City Park instead.  In 1966, the other public pools in the city were still closed, as Burns writes.  
 
The Baton Rouge Council on Human Relations was established in 1965 to foster community awareness of racial discriminatory practices and policies. To ensure compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Council monitored local restaurants, public parks, doctorsâ€™ offices, and other community facilities, such as public parks.</abstract>

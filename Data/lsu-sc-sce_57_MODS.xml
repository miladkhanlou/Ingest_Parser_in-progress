   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The tulip poplar is widespread in the eastern United States and is used for interior finishing and cabinetry.  Pioneers used it for building, as well, despite the softness of the wood.  A handsome ornamental with attractive leaves and flowers, it is relatively fast growing and becomes a large tree in the right conditions.  The national champion of the species stands 124 feet high.</abstract>
   <note type="content">Specimen collected by Margaret Stones, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 1976. Acquisition of this drawing was sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Hanna, Jr., in memory of Mr. and Mrs. W. T. Hanna and Mr. L. L. Morgan. Margaret Stones is widely recognized as one of the foremost living botanical illustrators.  Born in 1920, in Melbourne, Australia, she moved to England in 1951 to study botanical illustration at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in the course of a distinguished career became a principal illustrator for Kew Magazine and was selected as the artist for The Endemic Flora of Tasmania. Among numerous honors, she is a member of the Order of the British Empire and the Order of Australia; received from the Royal Horticultural Society the Veitch Silver Memorial Medal and the Veitch Gold Memorial Medal, and from the Garden Club of America the prestigious Eloise Payne Luquer Medal for special achievement in the field of botany; and holds honorary degrees from the University of Melbourne and LSU.  In 1976, Miss Stones was commissioned to create six watercolor drawings of Louisiana native flora to be a lasting legacy of LSU's bicentennial celebration. The LSU community was thrilled with the result, and the project soon blossomed with the support of people throughout Louisiana. By the time the project drew officially to a close in 1991, Miss Stones had created a major opus of more than 200 original watercolor drawings of Louisiana flora. The collection is unmatched in any other state.</note>

   <note type="content">Since 1986 the LSU Libraries' Special Collections division has been actively involved with the United States Newspaper Program, which seeks to preserve and make accessible newspapers printed in the fifty states and in the trust territories.   Two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities have made it possible for Louisiana Newspaper Project staff working for the LSU Libraries to cataloged all extant Louisiana newspapers they could locate in the state.  That cataloging information is available via the Internet using the OCLC Union List system. In addition, records for Louisiana newspapers held by the LSU Libraries can be found in the Libraries' online catalog. Since the 1950s, LSU Libraries staff have been microfilming Louisiana newspapers of record in order to preserve their historical content for future generations.  We continue to do this today, filming between 90 and 100 titles (approximately 70,000+ pages) each year, providing the film to our patrons, to parish libraries, and via interlibrary loan to people throughout the country. We also preserve historic newspapers pre-dating 1870, as well as special editions such as this lively Mardi Gras poster issued by the Times-Picayune.</note>

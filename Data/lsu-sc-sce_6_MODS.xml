   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Teams of scribes and artists worked to produce the illuminated Book of Hours on vellum.  This great treasure, donated to the LSU Libraries by John S. McIlhenny to serve as its ceremonial 2 millionth volume, dates from the 1430s.  Created in northern France or possibly in Paris, it is written on 163 leaves of fine vellum (a term commonly used for the highest quality of parchment) in a gothic book hand and illustrated with 12 miniatures, elaborate decorated borders, and many fine initial letters illuminated in colors and gold.  The miniatures depict biblical scenes, but they also reflect contemporary life in the mid-fifteenth century.</abstract>
   <note type="content">Manuscript on vellum, in a gothic bookhand.  8vo (196 x 140 mm.) 163 folios.  From the library of the Pasquier family of Paris.</note>

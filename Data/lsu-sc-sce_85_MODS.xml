   <note type="content">Thomas Affleck was a native of Scotland who immigrated to the United States in 1832. He studied agriculture and general sciences and became editor of the Western Farmer and Gardener, a widely circulated agricultural periodical in the West. He managed the plantations of his wife and stepson in Adams County, Mississippi; established one of the first commercial nurseries in the South; and published widely on scientific and agricultural subjects. Affleck moved his home and nursery to Washington County, Texas, before the Civil War. He promoted immigration of white labor to the South after the war and died in 1868.</note>

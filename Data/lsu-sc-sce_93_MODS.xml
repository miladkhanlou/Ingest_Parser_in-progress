   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Viela Spell lived and photographed scenes in Crowley, Louisiana, in Acadia Parish. When she began taking photographs in the 1920s the art of photography was no longer exclusive to professionals. Kodak had introduced the first disposable camera in the late 1880s with the advertising line, "You push the button, we do the rest." Anyone with enough money to buy a preloaded camera and pay for for printing could take up the hobby. Although not professional photographs, these images serve to document various aspects of Louisiana history that might otherwise have gone unrecorded.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">1) New port of entry in Bayou Pierre where all out-of-state boats must check their oyster and shrimp cargoes before leaving the State of Louisiana.  Former port of entry located in Grand Pass was destroyed by the 1947 hurricane.  2) Typical drilling operation showing the heavy equipment used.  The use of the equipment makes it necessary to be dredged in our shallow estuary waters.  3) Patrol boat "Captain Sandras" used for patrolling oyster areas.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In the past, the principle research conducted at the Marine Research Laboratory at Grand Terre was limited in great part to the Greater Barataria Bay area.  The new program will provide scientific and support personnel and equipment to work throughout the entire coastal area.  It will enable expansion and intensification of the biological program into all fields of fisheries research and management and will also permit development work such as oyster lease control monuments and shell plantings.</abstract>

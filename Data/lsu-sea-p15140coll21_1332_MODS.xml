   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The California Co. drills from barges in the Barataria field.  This canal was duy especially to give access to the proposed drill site, as water transport is more feasible than land travel through the marshes.  The rig is on a barge, sunk in the canal to give a solid foundation for drilling operations.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">1) The roller and bracket type of crab trotline apparatus. The line is threaded over a horizontal and two vertical rollers.  As the crabs clinging to the bait strike the roller, they drop into the funnel section of the "automatic dip net" and pass backward into the bag section. 2) This view of Scrapers for soft shell crabs shows how the delicate animals are protectively wrapped up in the Turtle Grass and other undersea vegitation.  3) Automatic Crab Trotline Dip Net - Here are shown in detail the single horizontal and double vertical rollers.  The crab trotline passes first over the horizontal roller and then between the vertical rollers.  The crabs drop into the square basket-like funnel shown below the rollers.  4)  A Crab Scraper or Dredge utilized for capturing soft shell crabs in typically grassy "shedding" areas.  The gear rolls the crabs up unharmed in the dead grass, thereby also cultivatin and improving the growth of the necessary underwater plant life.</abstract>

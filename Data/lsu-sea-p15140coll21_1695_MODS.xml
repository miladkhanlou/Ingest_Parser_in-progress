   <abstract displayLabel="Description">In this picture is shown the newest method of scattering oyster shells in Louisiana waters for the tiny young oysters to attach themselves to when they first sink to the water bottom.  This method replaces the one formerly used in which these shells were scattered by hand with shovels.  It was developed during the summer of 1943 because of the shortage of manpower, and it has been found that this method scatters the shells much more evenly, in much less time, and at much less expense.</abstract>

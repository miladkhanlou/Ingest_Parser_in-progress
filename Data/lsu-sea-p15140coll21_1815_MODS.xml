   <abstract displayLabel="Description">On January 8, 1815, the guns positioned here fired at British counter batteries loacted almost 1/2 mile in front of you.  During the battle, these guns caused heavy casualties as the British advanced along the levee road.  The troops attacking to the right of the position numbered about 1200 men commanded by Colonel Robert Rennie of the 93rd Regiment.  To the left were 355 men of Major Jean Baptiste Plauche's Battalion of Uniformed Companies and 282 members of Major Lacoste's Battalion of Free Men of Color.  Located between here and battery 1 were 440 men of the 7th Infantry.</abstract>

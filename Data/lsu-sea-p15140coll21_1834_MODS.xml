   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The main American Position was nearing completion when a redoubt was constructed at the extreme right of the American line.  It contained two artillery pieces that could rake the levee and canal.  On the morning of January 5, 1815, 2000 British troops under the command of Colonel Robert Rennie attacked the redoubt and forced the Americans to retire.  They quickly counterattacked and the British retreated after a brief fight.  Failure to penetrate the American Flank contributed to the overal British defeat.</abstract>

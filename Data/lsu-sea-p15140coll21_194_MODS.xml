   <abstract displayLabel="Description">These are the boats of Bayou Lafourche. In the foreground is the pirogue, as indispensable to the bayou dweller as lipstick is to a lady and, incidentally, the oldest inhabitant of the parish.  It came with the Indian and glided out to meet the first white man just about in the same shape it is today.  Beyond are the fishing craft- three sizes for two different purposes.  The smaller pair are luggers that operate in the lakes, bays and shallow gulf water.  The large lugger in the background will cruise out fifty miles in the Gulf of Mexico, pursuing the jumbo shrimp.</abstract>

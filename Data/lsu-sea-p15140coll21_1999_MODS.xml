   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Known also as the Grande Ecaille and the Silver King, the tarpon is one of the sport fishes concerning which constant inquiries are received by the Bureau of Research.  A marvelous fighter, the Tarpon calls forth the angler's highest skill.  The present world's record for this species is a Tarpon 8 feet, 2 inches long, with an estimated weight of 350 pounds.  Six foor Tarpon are common in Louisiana waters.  The Tarpon leaves the Louisiana coast during the winter, makings the reappearance in late March.</abstract>

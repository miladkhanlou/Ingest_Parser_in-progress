   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Here he is- a typical Plaquemines Parish muskrat trapper, heading out to visit his traps, a chore he must do every day by law during the season.  In the summertime he will fish for oysters and shrimp.  He is healthy, happy, and never hungry and wouldn't trade you his life in the bayous and bays of his beloved parish for all your city conveniences even if you threw in a bonus.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">1) To dig canals back into Louisiana's trapping grounds, this unique but effective equipment is often used.  Whirling knives on the front of this flatboat, driven by a gasoline motor, literally bore a waterway through the trembling prairie.  2) These few mink furs, held by Clem Perrin, fur buyer, represent about $500 to the trapper who sold them to him. 3) The whole family pitches in during trapping season.  Here the trapper's children are shown hanging up the day's catch of muskrat skins to dry.</abstract>

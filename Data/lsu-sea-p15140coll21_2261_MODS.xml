   <abstract displayLabel="Description">A wagonload of decoys being transferred to a houseboat at the beginning of the season, Havre de Grace, Md., c. 1900.  The steam tug Baltimore (background) upset during a storm, killing her crew.  Many vessels of her class did the same thing because they were topheavy.  Left to right: Lewis Mergler, Lee Hawkins, Ed. Goak, Wm. Fadeley, Arthur Deppish, Ed Poplar, Barry Woods, Curly Way.</abstract>

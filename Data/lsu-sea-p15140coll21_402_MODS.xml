   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The result of controlled burning of the marsh on muskrat lands.  With water on the ground and a fresh wind blowing the fire swept over the muskrat houses without setting them afire.

A fire set during the dry spell would cause a great deal of damage, it has been demonstrated.</abstract>

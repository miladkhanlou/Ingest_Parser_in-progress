   <abstract displayLabel="Description">(Right)
The Acadians were deported from Nova Scotia in 1735.  Shortly after, New England settlers moved into the Fundy revion and profited from the Acadians hard work.  Unable to maintain the dyke system themselves, the new settlers relied on the talent of Acadians who escaped exile.'
During the 1940's many unrepaired dykes allowed the sea to recapture land and convert it back to marsh.  Fearing the loss of prime farmland, the government launced a program to support dyke restoration.  By the 1960's over 300 kilometers of dykes protected over 33,000 hectares (88,200 acres) of farmland.  In addition to the simple Acadian dykes, dams were installed across large riveres to further regulate tidal flow.  At this time, all attention was focused on saving profitable farmland and little consideration was given to possible environmental consequences.'(Left)
The only Acadians remaining in Nova Scotia were those who escaped into the woods and peacfully co-existed with the Mi'kmaq Indians.  It was these survivors who later emerged to continue the Acadian bloodline in the Nova Scotia town of Moncton (named for the British colonel in charge of the deportation) has become a hotspot for modern Acadian revival.</abstract>

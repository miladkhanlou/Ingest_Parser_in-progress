   <abstract displayLabel="Description">The experimental muskrat plots on the fur experimental farm on Avoca Island, near Morgan City.  Here the cooperating biologist is studying the muskrat, and other fur-bearers, under semi-natural conditions.  The muskrat plots shown in the photograph are 47x100 feet, approximately one tenth of an acre in area each.  A walk is built over them so the observer can make notes on the habits of the muskrats without trampling on their runways or otherwise disturbing them.  The one inch mesh wire fence is two feet underground, three feet above the surfaec and with a one-foot overhang to keep the inhabitants in the plots.  One-inch mesh wire, galvanized after weaving, has proved better than wire galvanized before weaving.</abstract>

   <abstract displayLabel="Description">This Indian mound was constructed around AD 1000.  It is 7 feet tall with a square-shaped base.  It was once part of a larger complex made up of five mounds.  The oak tree on the northwest corner of the mound is thought to mark the grave of Houma Courtea alias Touh-la-bayne of the Biloxi nation who owned this property between 1822-1844.  The historic Picou Cemetery on top dates from 1901-1990s.</abstract>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Barnes discusses his childhood in Clinton and Baton Rouge, La., which involved being raised by his widowed mother and working from a young age.  The family grew their own food and resources were scarce.  As an adult Barnes helped raise a number of children in Lafourche Parish, and he discusses, at length, how Christian tenets have helped guide his life.  He discusses the history and development of Israelite Baptist Church in Lockport, explaining his role as deacon and as a member of the church choir.  Barnes sings two gospel songs.  He discusses his professional career at Valentine Sugar in Lockport, where he climbed to the rank of overseer/manager, which caused some strain as Barnes is African American and many colleagues were white.  After Valentine closed he worked night shifts at a sugar mill in Raceland. He briefly discusses the non-church community and changes in the physical community of Bayou Lafourche.  Barnes's long medical history is also discussed.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">John B. "J.B." Barnes, Jr. was born in Clinton, La., around 1923 and was raised with a rural lifestyle in Baton Rouge.  His father died when he was still young, so Barnes was raised by his mother and began to work and contribute to the household at an early age.  He moved to Lockport, La., in 1954 for a job at the Valentine Sugar Company, where he worked on their Valite division and eventually became a plantation overseer, managing the labor force of hundreds, both black and white.  After Valentine's closure in 1979 [1980], Barnes also worked as a water attendant at a sugar house in Raceland.  He was a member of St. John Baptist Church in Clinton and Israelite Baptist Church in Lockport; he served as a church deacon and member of the choir at Israelite Baptist.  Barnes, son of John Barnes, Sr. and Anna Thomas Barnes, was one of many children, and was married to Sally Barnes; the couple had five children and he mentored many more.  He passed away in 2012 and is survived by three sons, one daughter, many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</note>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Williams discusses his childhood in Golden Meadow, both the activities he participated in and also his moral upbringing, which was influenced by his parents and the Catholic Church. He discusses his experience with French at home and at school, and the importance of family. He recalls flooding in Golden Meadow, and mentions (briefly) his time at Nicholls State and serving in the U.S. Army during Vietnam. He explains that he got his job because of a workplace accident which killed his father. He discusses his daughters' education and how the family still socializes around sporting events.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Larry Williams was born in 1947 and raised in Golden Meadow, Louisiana, where he spoke both Cajun French with his grandparents and English. He attended Nicholls State University for two semesters and then served the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, 1966-1968. In that year he married his high school sweetheart and was briefly stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia. He worked at Texaco for his entire career; he secured the job after his father, also a Texaco employee, was killed on a rig explosion. Williams, a practicing Catholic, is still married, but now retired. He has three grown daughters.</note>

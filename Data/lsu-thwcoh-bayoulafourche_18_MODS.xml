  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Adams discusses his childhood on Bobs Lane in Golden Meadow, La., and what children did for recreation, which included hunting and sports.  He spent time with his father in the garden, hunting, and at church.  He was raised Catholic and his father was particularly devout.  Adams recalls the shrimp packing plants in Golden Meadow and discusses the local fishing culture, including recent developments.  He discusses, throughout the interview, how Golden Meadow has changed, specifically the sense of community, commerce and development.  He talks about his first job at the ice plant, and about the Golden Meadow Police Department, where he worked from 1976 to 2005.  Adams recalls his grandparents and his family's Cajun heritage.</abstract>

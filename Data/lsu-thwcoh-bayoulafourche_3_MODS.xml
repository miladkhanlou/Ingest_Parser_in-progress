  <abstract displayLabel="Description">LeBlanc discusses his French Catholic upbringing, and the importance of community, family, and education in his youth.  He talks about his early marriage and career with Humble Oil, and about switching careers into the nascent insurance industry, in which he had financial and professional success.  He discusses the physical and socioeconomic topography of Bayou Lafourche, talking about its changes over the past sixty years, and its current physical reduction and financial inequalities.  He talks about the impact of hurricanes on Bayou Lafourche.  He discusses his family history and his offspring.  He mentions his participation in a community of local French speakers who are trying to preserve the language, and the importance of doing so.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Augustin "A.J." LeBlanc, was born July 9, 1936, in Lockport, Louisiana, and is one of three sons of Augustin LeBlanc, Sr.  He grew up speaking French at home, and his house did not have electricity until after World War II.  He was raised, and continues to be, an observant Catholic, and education was always emphasized by his parents.  After high school he married and began working for Humble Oil (now Exxon), but left in 1958 to study insurance marketing at University of Southwest Louisiana.  He set up a State Farm-affiliated practice in Larose, which grew to be very successful.  He and his wife have four children and a number of grandchildren, live in Larose and have a camp in Leeville.</note>

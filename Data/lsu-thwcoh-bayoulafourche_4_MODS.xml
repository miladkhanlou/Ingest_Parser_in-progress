  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Belonie Scioneaux was born in 1931 in Vacherie, Louisiana, the son of Ernest and Martha Scioneaux. His family was employed by a plantation on which they lived, and he began working at a young age. As an adult he worked at Avondale Shipyard for a time before leaving because of health problems. He married at least twice (second wife: Audrey Kraemer Scioneaux), and had several children and stepchildren. Scioneaux, a native French speaker and resident of Chackbay, enjoyed hunting and helping at his daughter's restaurant, Nocko's Deli, until his death in 2011.</note>

  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Kuyrkendall grew up in Galliano, Louisiana, a small town in Lafourche Parish.  She discusses her childhood on the bayou, which she enjoyed, although she faced a few challenges because of her hearing impairment (e.g., she couldn't hear threats, like snakes, approaching).  She recalls the transition of moving to the Louisiana School for the Deaf in 1961.  Kuyrkendall discusses her professional life: first at a shrimp factory, then at a grocery store, and then her career as a florist, which she discusses at length, including her year working in Las Vegas, getting her professional license, and the floral shops she helped establish.  Kuyrkendall discusses her Catholic faith, and talks about the challenges of deaf people today, especially in regards to professional opportunities.  She also shares her recollections of Hurricane Betsy (1965), which destroyed her family's home.</abstract>

  <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Evelyn Cheramie Kuyrkendall was born in Galliano, Louisiana, around 1950.  She attended the local public school from age six to eleven, then in 1961 moved to Baton Rouge to attend the Louisiana School for the Deaf, from which she graduated in 1968.  After working as a flower delivery girl in Bayou Lafourche, in 1974 she moved to Las Vegas to work and train.  Kuyrkendall returned to Louisiana in 1976, and in that year passed her Louisiana State Floral License exam.  She opened three flower shops in south Louisiana, including The General Store Flower &amp; Gift Shop in Golden Meadow, Louisiana, before marrying (1985) and moving to Baton Rouge.  She worked for Edrie's Flower Shop.  She continues to do floral designs for special events, and serves as a house mother at the Louisiana School for the Deaf.  Her daughter Jennifer interpreted most of the interview.</note>

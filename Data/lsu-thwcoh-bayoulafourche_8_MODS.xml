  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Danos discusses his childhood in Larose and Cut Off, La., including his grandfather's sugar cane farm and the slightly more populated neighborhood in Cut Off.  Danos recalls transportation options and the physical construction of the community, and how it was changed.  Danos says living in Bayou Lafourche is defined by pride of culture and independence.  He discusses the oil industry's growth, role, and his contributions through Danos and Curole.  He discusses hurricanes, his current approach to them, and the role the floodgates have had on the local community.  He describes his maternal grandfather's house, as well as the house his parents built in Cut Off.  He also recalls food options on the bayou (groceries and restaurants), then and now.</abstract>

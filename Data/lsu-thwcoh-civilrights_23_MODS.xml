   <note type="biographical/historical" displayLabel="Biographical Note">Johnnie Jones, Sr. was born in Laurel Hill, La., in 1919. After completing sixth grade, he worked for Ransom Lumber Company in Woodville, Miss., where he lived with his boss, Mr. Hergen, and tutored Hergen's son, Buddy. Jones later was sent to live with his uncle in Scotlandville, La., to begin his high school education at Southern University Demonstration School. He went on to Southern University for a year and a half until he was drafted into the U.S. Army to serve in World War II. He was one of the first African-American warrant officers and he took part in the D-Day invasion, landing in the third wave at Omaha Beach. After the war, Jones returned to Southern University to finish his bachelor's degree in psychology. After graduating, he married Sebell Chase and worked for two years at the post office. He then went on to Southern University Law School and earned his law degree in 1953. Jones' legal career included several landmark civil rights cases.</note>

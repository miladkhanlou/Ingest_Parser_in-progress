  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Bell discusses how his upbringing in South Baton Rouge encouraged him to explore the arts, which came naturally to him.  He recalls the influence of his arts education by family members, friends, and other artists in the community. He describes his early works and traces the influence of various artists who instilled in him the values of simplicity, sincerity and hard work.  He recalls influences and opportunities in New Orleans, Chicago, New York, Detroit, Canada and Japan. He expounds on the spiritual influences on his work and how he still draws inspiration from his early life experiences. Finally, he discusses teaching young artists and urging them to resist material interests and build their confidence.</abstract>

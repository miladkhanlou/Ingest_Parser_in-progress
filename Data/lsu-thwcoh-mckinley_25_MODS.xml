  <abstract displayLabel="Description">Douglas talks extensively about his creative process and concepts, including his cartoon characters, his caricature business, his ideas for children's books and toys, and plans for films and TV shows. He recalls weather and sports-related artwork he completed for New Orleans broadcasters Hap Glaudi and Bob Breck. Inspired by his father's example of turning ideas into money, Douglas is a powerhouse of plans. He compares public schools in New Orleans and Baton Rouge and details his approaches to teaching art to youth. He discusses artists in the South Baton Rouge community, his experiences as an artist there, and his concern over young people's declining appreciation of art and music.</abstract>

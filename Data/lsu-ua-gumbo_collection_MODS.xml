  <note type="content" displayLabel="Collection Description">Gumbo Magazine initially was a triannual publication issued by the Department of Student Media.  It expanded to quarterly frequency in the fall of 1992 after the Gumbo yearbook was discontinued for lack of funding.  For the next two years, Gumbo Magazine took up the task of recording an historical account of the year as the yearbook had done, while continuing much of its traditional magazine feature content.  The Gumbo yearbook returned in the 1994/95 academic year, freeing the magazine to return to its former practice of covering interesting people and subjects on campus.  It changed its name to Legacy in 1994.</note>

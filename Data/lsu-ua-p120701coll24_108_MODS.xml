   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Seismogram recorded in the Howe-Russell Geoscience Complex during the Louisiana State University vs. Auburn University football game on October 8, 1988. Trailing by six points, LSU quarterback Tommy Hodson threw a touchdown pass to tailback Eddie Fuller on fourth down with 1:47 remaining in the game. The eruption of the crowd registered on the seismograph, shaking the ground as much as a small earthquake.</abstract>

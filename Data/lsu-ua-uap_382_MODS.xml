   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Photograph of participants in the Fourth Annual Short Course for Boys and Girls held at Louisiana State University from August 13-17, 1917.  The course was offered through the Cooperative Extension Service as part of Louisiana State University's land grant mission.  Members of agricultural clubs from throughout the state of Louisiana were invited to attend to learn about innovations in agriculture and home economics.  The photograph was taken on LSUâ€™s campus when it was located in downtown Baton Rouge.  The building in the background in the middle is the original Hill Memorial Library.  On the right is Alumni Memorial Hall, and next to it is the original Peabody Hall. The photograph belonged to Ella Chachere Schatzle, who attended the Short Course.</abstract>

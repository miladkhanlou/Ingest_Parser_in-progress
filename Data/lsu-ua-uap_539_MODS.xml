   <abstract displayLabel="Description">Photographs from the November 4, 1972 game LSU vs. Ole Miss at Tiger Stadium. This series of shots show the last second of the game in which Bert Jones threw a touchdown pass to Brad Davis to tie up the game. The scoreboard images show before and after the touchdown extra point, a diagram of the play, and action shots of the play.  Coach Charles McClendon said this after the game:  “We always tell our players not to give up even if there’s one second on the board and that’s what it came down to Saturday night.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The photographs are featured in the 2009 book,  Historic Photos of LSU Football, by Barry Cowan and Mark E. Martin.</abstract>

parser.py Good points to add:
	a.	If tag was not closed
	b.	count of collision
	c.	showing the error and where it happened 
	d.	argument for command-line python code


Migration to New LDL:
	1.	Identify all the paths for completing our knowledge of existing fields with parser.py
	2.	Process and add the text to relevant fields with xml2workbench.py
	3.	Post-Process to create relationshipts with Post_process.py (or add to xml2workbench.py)
	4.	Run workbench to ingest
